you walk into your house
the crumbling structure fumbling 
under its own great weight
the dusty floors boards creak
with each step you take
what could this all be?
what could it all mean?


You make your way through
the halls and to your room
where your toys lay
the ones that only children play with
but here you are and here you'll be
the man that was once the man that could see


the soul of plastic parts
making up his toy cars 
lay broken on his bed
the pieces lay faded
and he picks up each piece 
to find his mind and memories 
dissolved in his playthings
dissolved in everything he knew
lost and tossed away
lost but found decayed
lost and found again


You came back to your senses
and the toys remain lifeless
the same lack of movement
But moving is what we need
to feed our bodies and souls
so you dance at incredible speed
but it still leaves a hole
a hole wide and deep


Maybe the toys are faded
Or maybe youre too jaded 
but the past has failed us
and what succeeds it has too
so best not get worked up
when the memories fail you
so best not get worked up
when the memories fail you


you soul is trapped
in the things you love
from the old knitted cap 
to the old worn out gloves
but dont go back to your house,
there is nothing there to do
the things you loved are coated in dust
dont let the dust cover you
dont let the dust cover you
dont let the dust cover you
dont let the dust cover you




I'm doing my best in low budget hotels
But this paperwork pileup is my living hell
I pick up the phone, I wanna talk to my child
But all I can hear is the tone of the dial


I miss hearing 'em running on kitchen tile floor
Through carpet of the living room, straight out the door
They all try to tell me that time's on my side
Sweetie, remember me, at least I had tried


And the faults of my history get turned round against me
I don't want any part of it
Now I don't care much about who took the win
Baby please, I need the kids


I thought I had finally built my family
But the anger has sucked out the humanity
I should've told you how much I regret
Because now you refuse to hear any of it


It got so damn ugly when we brought in the suits
Our love was a time bomb no one could defuse
The kids don't deserve to be caught in the mix
But you can't pretend like I don't exist


And this whole goddamn history is turning against me
I don't want any part of it
It's like everything I know has now gone to deep shit
Honey please, I need the kids


I'll pay all the bills that I have and don't have
If you let me in to at least have a laugh
I'll wait until the day you let these thoughts go away
Let me stay
Let me stay


And this whole goddamn history is turning against me
I'm sick and tired of it
They need to know that I was there for just a little bit
Honey please, I need the kids




You got a sense of humor
Yeah you've got a sense of humor
Break away from this cold day
Yeah break away from this hold and
Kill the children yeah just
Kill the children


Before they grow and before they're old
Before they're old but after they know
That they can't get anything done
Yeah no one gets anything done
So just break the buildings
I'll break them all


Crawling space and breathing room
I'm not alive but I'm still breathing
Day time seeping as night time looms
I'm still blind and I'm now leaving


Hollow bones and broken wings
I can't fly and neither can you
Break his legs don't let him walk
I can try and break in two


We're all experts at that
No one left intact


I'm feeling ill
A sickness that spreads like
Some kinda fungi
It comes and goes


It's hard to kill
This thing just won't die
It happens all the time
Nobody knows


In a different game
I'm leaving for something
An alternate offering
Where I can't lose


But I know its name
It wants me all alone
As something it can own
And walk in my shoes


But staying home is reminding me
Of a person I don't wanna be
Anymore


It's hard to hear
Through narrative thunder
Sometimes I wonder
Is it still near?


But staying home is reminding me
Of a person I don't wanna be
And despite this awful quarantine
I still feel it's infecting me
I'm sure


But I'm something new
I won't give up and die
But sometimes I'd just like
To see it through




stuck inside 
losing my mind to minecraft
days slip me by 
cuz sleeping deep and seeping into the cracks
means i cant keep time
but i couldnt really do that anyway


I got some important questions to ask
like why am I here and why am i so sad
look down with pity cuz i really feeling shitty
i need your attention even if its just a second


whoaaa why is life so hard
it feels as if it was rigged from the start
whoaaa I cant help but sing about me
yet theres nothing nothing i wanna be


dont mind me but i got something to say
ive recently been using my big brain 
to come up with thoughts that keep me down
make sure to turn that smile into a sad little frown
no please stop laughing and take me seriously
i swear being sad isnt my entire personality
STOP LAUGHING RIGHT NOW THIS ISNT FAIR THIS IS 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


whoaaa why is life so hard
it feels as if it was rigged from the start
whoaaa I cant help but sing about me
yet theres nothing nothing i wanna be


whoaaa im bored as hell
please get on call so you can be bored as well
whooaa this song is a train wreck
your dumb if you enjoy this dreck




Well I miss you
And that can suck for a couple of reasons
These people ain't much for feeling
Just a bunch of dead end jokes
With no setup or payoff to hold them up
And I've been thinking I don't belong here
But have you tried breathing in the atmosphere?
With the promise that the sun will eat us up
And now time's stopped until we call her bluff


It's been tiring
These people think they're conspiring
Always waiting for the next drop of the shoe to shake the world
And undo this dance of confusing blues
And I've always been more of a folky guy
But I was never that kind of dancing child
And I know no one can change my face into a smiling mess
And that's all well and good


But this world
Doesn't stop itself from changing anyhow
All I can hope
Is that I'll soon learn to turn myself around
Just like you would


So I stretched my face as much as I could
It didn't help in all likelihood
I saw it again, a calloused kin
Who would glare too often at shedding skin
Well maybe I'd give up trying to peel
If you didn't always make me heal
But I'm sidetracked anyway
Right now I don't need this in my brain


Brother there was so much I didn't tell you
And that can suck for a lot of reasons
All these demons repeating fever spikes
It's like the circle came to say good night
You don't really know what I've been through
But why should that matter at all?
I just wanna spiral down into
A love where I don't have to fall


But this world
Doesn't stop itself from changing anyhow
All I can hope
Is that I'll soon learn to turn myself around
Just like you would


Well I love you
But each of us could die any day now
And we need to know that that's okay somehow
Owed nothing at all
But at least we don't owe them for our pitfalls
It's been raining
So much more these days
Just complaining until it goes away
But maybe it's a curveball
On a bigger scale




Look down at my feet and see nothing there
This killin heat burns my hair
I can touch my skin almost everyday
I'll make a puddle and float away


Drain my precious time thinking precious thoughts
About my precious dime and my precious watch
So I can remember all the things that I did not
Get to do cuz of my PRECIOUS WATCH


What are you watching?
Don't stare at the ground
Just take a look around


What are you watching?
Don't watch your suit and tie
They don't mean much when you lie


In the ground


Look down at my feet to see nothing at all
Just a puddle in the middle of the hall
So I should pack up my things go naked for a while
And live in the woods and be like a child


Because I drained my precious time and precious life
Thinking the puddle will disappear overnight and become
Someone who existed even for just an instant
Wild how this wild life can be so consistent
Wild how my life can be so resistant to change


What are you watching?
Don't stare at the ground
Just take a look around


What are you watching?
Don't watch your suit and tie
They don't mean much when you lie


In the ground




This is the story of a man named Jonah
Who tried to run from God


The word of the Lord came to Jonah one night:
He said: “You must preach to the Nineties
For their wickedness I no longer can ignore.”
But Jonah decided to run away
He found a boat, and the fare he paid
He was headed to Tarshish to flee from the Lord.


“How could you forgive them after what they’ve done? 
If it’s mercy from me you want, then I have none
Maybe you can forgive them, Lord, but I’d rather run.”


Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea
And as the sailors panicked, they found Jonah asleep
They said, “Call on your god, and maybe then we will not die.”
Jonah told them “my God made heavens and the sea
This storm is here because from him I tried to flee
To save yourselves, you must throw me over the side.”


“Lord, have I ever been a fool of a man
To run from the God who made the seas and the land
Had I known it’d be like this, I would’ve followed your plan.”


The sea calmed, but Jonah sank under the waves
But his Prophet, the Lord did not forsake
He sent a giant fish to swallow Jonah whole
And through his power, God kept Jonah alive
Inside that whale for three days and nights
And in that fish, God healed Jonah’s soul


“As I sank into the depths of the sea
I cried out to you Lord, and you heard my plea
Salvation comes from you God, and now it’s come to me.”


Then God spoke to Jonah a second time:
“Preach my word to those Nineties”
And though Jonah’s heart was still cold
He told them “40 more days before you are overthrown”
And the people repented and turned from their ways
A fast was proclaimed by the king the next day
And when God saw how the people’s hearts turned to him
He spared them from their destruction


But to Jonah this seemed very wrong
And he went and pouted all day long
He said “Lord I knew you’d spare them just like you said”
The Lord grew a plant to grant Jonah some shade 
Then he commanded a worm to eat the plant that he had made
And as it died Jonah cried out, “Now I wish I was dead”


Jonah, you care for this plant that died in a day
Should I not care for these people doomed for the grave?
For the thousands that I love, and that you helped save?




No don't worry
Nothing's forever
It seems like that's all I'll be able to say
Before it takes me too


Just another plot
On another sheet of a screenplay
I'll always find some reason
To be under the weather


And they think that it won't last too long
But the times we're living in
Are feeling kind of strange
That's all people can think to say these days
That's all people can think to say these days


Not much left
Only a few weeks to endure
Been tough to stave off being lazy


Hard to think
When everyone's calling each other crazy
I think it's crazy how anyone can act so sure


And they think that it won't last too long
But the times we're living in
Are feeling kind of strange
That's all people can think to say these days
That's all people can think to say these days


my soul is moving towards a bright and nicely decorated distraction
something stoping from moving forwards so im just gonna stay back relaxin
let the world spin away nothing there for me anyway
i wouldnt want to touch you let my hug you in a warm embrace


the hole in my head filled with thoughts of dead and graying fraying hair
leave it all behind behind the emptyness im feeling there


you smell scentless apathetic sense the world is senseless cuz its
mine, mine and mind alone
i hope you see if you move i lose you so lets groove to a tune please don't
go away, id love to see you never change


ive got a crack addiction self induced mental affliction
since everything i write makes as much sense as the next line
i could hear you all day spin your record and hear it play
but thats just me i fear since i hold everything near to me


the hole in my soul filled with thoughts suspended in mid air
leave it all below below the emptyness im not feeling there


stream of conciousness a subtle bliss just keep me here 
oooooo i just wanna write like this
river flowing and exploding out reaching breaching all about
yooou i just need you in my fist


cuz im getting tired lately seem to be aching daily
something watching me so nearly no longer able to see clearly
2020 vision but that was a long time ago 
waited all these years so you could be here tomorrow




Alright, alright, alright.


Gather round everyone, and listen closely. You’re about to hear...something


Did you hear that? Did someone just laugh? What was that? Weird.


That was pretty good, yeah?


Take it away, boys


I feel infected...with a beat!
Nah it’s probably something else


This song was made possible by the power of Pepsi




And by the time they put their weapons down
The loss had caused another round
And I stood in disbelief
Because it couldn't have been up to me
To pull something out of thin air
Is a task that asks to much to care
Spent up on characters too cursed to last


I bought my way out of this town
Blending in with a face full of frowns
That could turn the sun around
Nothing unordinary to be found
At one quick glance, no one could share
Interest in a 1000 yard stare
So when it came to say goodbye
I'd see right through that lie


To an open casket
Funeral that leaves me laughing
Every way is a bad way to go
If only we had something
More under these passing jokes
If only you spoke again
The same thing but with less substance


Well kid, you look kind of insane
To curse the night for not staying
But don't turn to look his way
'Til he's got something important to say
Then comes this other side of him
Come to collect his pension
Cut off from his only kin
And died as nothing interesting


I hope that when it's time to
Go I don't know because
Every way is a bad way to go
I only wanted to be
Floating in the black and cold
You might be right again
At least that's what I'd like to think




If I got into a rocket ship heading for outer space
Would you miss me? Would you kiss me on the face before I flew away?
We’d count the seconds down until I’d have to leave
Me in the air you on the ground, tears on our cheeks I’m sorry I couldn’t stay


And all this time we spent together would it mean more or less?
Does absence make the heart grow fond or would I just end up depressed?
Stars would intermingle with my dreams and I would see you there
Both cruel and beautiful how much I care and the growing space


I’m playing cards with my imaginary friends
I don’t pretend that they are real but I still let them win so they feel alright
And if it’s all just gonna to go up into flames
I would want them to know that I’m not to blame I cared for them the whole time


But as the days go bye I look and see them start to fade
“Don’t leave me here! You mean too much to me to just disappear!”
And as my shadow eats them one by one they start to say
From the wall “It’s not your fault, some things just happen this way.”


I walked along the bottom of the sea to find a giant eel
With wicked teeth he planned to make me his next meal, but he was all alone
When I offered him my company there in the deep
He valued me not as a tasty treat but as a partner of his own


Now we swim together through the waters dark and cold
We terrorize the populace as we both grow old, and though his face
To most is terrible beyond belief to me it looked to be
The face of one I loved the most in all the sea and in this place




Oh your exuberance leaves me baffled all the time
And I'd hope sometimes that you would share it and someday I'd find mine
Still falling towards a rock bottom that always moves away
While you sit on your mountain and the wind fails to sway


I just can't believe you
I used to wanna be you
I just can't believe you
I just wanna be with you


But you didn't climb as high as I once thought you did
I guess the perfect person wouldn't be as interesting
Strangely entranced by all the things I'd sometimes think to say
Always saving me from the sound taking another round to sit alone and flay


I just can't believe you
I used to wanna be you
I just can't believe you


I spent some time picking my shit up off the floor
I wanna be better than I used to be before
And I'm so happy that I get to break this voice with you
We're gonna end up tearing the pavement into two


Just wait for the song to surround us
And the world moved so quickly around us
As if we had somewhere to be
But that somewhere was always with me
Now I'm locked down in suburban drywall
Remembering the cold air this past fall
I loved to go driving with you
But we drove through it all way too soon




believe what you want to believe
see what you wanna perceive
I font care, doesn't affect me or bother me in the least


hold on to your stupid dreams
I'm much to old for your childish schemes
I'm not gonna play chicken in the pool that's dumb


you hurt those around you
but this is the life that you choose
when you edgeguard your teammate trying to save him


why cant you listen 
I repeat into the ears your missing
I've called out his position please hes hit like 99 bro


I've pushed myself to the brink
feels like everything's covered in ink
but its not and I'm whining not winning I don't think


but here you have returned 
when your heart's become firm
and you 4 wide you fucker I almost had a t spin

Welcome to Sunnyshine!...Industries


I am not a proud man but I still fought for that win
I am not a speaker but I still learned how to sing
I refuse to choose and be certain
I am not anything


I am pretty quiet but you can still hear me screaming
I have perfect hearing but I can still hear that damn ring
I am far too different but what difference does that make?
I am not anything
I'm not anything


I am pretty bright but catch me being dim
I don't talk about myself but I still wrote this fucking thing
I should have thick skin but everything still stings
I am not anything


I'm a little kid who doesn't like to have any fun
I am not an athlete but all I do is run
Every sentence starts with I except for this one
I am not anything
I'm not anything


Right when everything was looking up
The bomb dropped
And time stopped
And no one fought
Because the most tragic things have nobody to blame


And I just want someone to break these walls down
And take this house by storm
While I alone forget the difference
Between the artist's work and the human form


What is meant to be somber and free
In this place green and blue?
Well all I know for sure is you're my cure
And I'm just better off with you


never been one to talk 
but neither are you so i guess we're fucked
feeling under the weather whether or not I'm outside
but one day ill crash and burn alive


to find you


entombed in my head 
something holding me back
but im back from the dead
hope I make up your mind 
do you mind making up mine
cuz my hearts been thawed by a flawed summer cold


never been one to talk 
but walking in two's was a stroke of luck
my wheels can slip on a rainy day
feels like a hop skip jump stone toss away


and ill find you


waiting there to sing a tune 
glad that I could be your muse
but soon i think ill be gone 
dont let your screws get too undone
cuz my hearts been clawed by a flawed summer cold


but enough worrying about all that trash 
cure for sadness is a snare and a crash
so when the world stands still and no ones around
ill feel ill unless we speed around town


and my hair grows at an alarming pace
and my life slows like its losing a race


God telling me to take some time off and relax 
mind helping me get back on track


cuz I
i just wanna be loud with you 
i just wanna be loud with you
i just wanna be loud with you
i just wanna be allowed to be loud with you




Love leads me down a different path
The faces that I have come to pass
Means nothing more to me at last
It's nothing far out of reach now


But I keep falling down different routes
And end up in the same place somehow
While the city's flames grow far too loud
And proud to grow out this callous


Lest I forget the danger round every bend
What an awful message this source has sent
And I don't even know where the sound went


But angry folk have come knocking at the door
The working hand is always gonna want war
But I don't fight for a living anymore


Call callous ways counter effect
You'll never make me see with un level heads
There's only so many things I can protect
Sometimes people get so angry


But there are those who I would help gladly
Giving a voice where there should be
The strongest vocal cords I've ever seen
I know what love looks like


To me there doesn't need to be a price over every head
There's still a whole lot of skin to shed
You don't need to hide behind everything you've said


But there are birds who refute their right to soar
And I've always lived feeling unsure
But I don't fight for a living anymore




This is a yelling song
For the nights that go too long
For when that clock hits 4am
And things start to get interesting’


A song for when I feel like garbage
And need to scream it out, I doubt
This song will clear my mind, but it might
Clear out my heart


A song for when I’m happy
Or down in the dumps
Or if I like a girl a little too much
This is a song for all these things
And for when all I wanna do is sing


This is a yelling song
For the days that go so wrong
For when I feel so worthless
And that I’m living with no purpose


A song for when I cannot feel God’s love
So strong what’s going on
A song to realign my heart and say
God ain’t too far away from me


A song for heartache
A song of dreams 
A song for emotional extremes
For when I want to extend
The way I feel for just a bit


This is a yelling song
This is a yelling song
This is a yelling song
This is a yelling song!


This is a song for when
I don’t want to night to end
Running from the dawn to stay
By your side until the day begins


For when I feel too much inside
And I must let it out or die
For heaven to hear my cry
As I sing to you God


A song for laughter
A song for tears
A song to forget all your fears
It’s a song for me, and maybe you
And it’s a song that’s gonna end real soon




When you get the vision
That I'm moving on
I set my ambitions
Down right upon
The table I brought in
From drying today
I won't say I'm loving
But I could live living this way


I won't get to go home
Anytime soon
For nature's overgrown
Straight through my room
I'm bound to this school bus
Like a lyric is bound
To maintain its focus
On rhyming with the next vowel's sound


And I always believed I would sing a different song
Of my dreams or my friends or that monster belong
But there are some things that I won't get to bring
Whether you like it or not everything else
Is moving on


They offered sanctuary
In a much different land
But it felt too scary
So I withdrew my hand
There are broken humans
We believed we could trust
Until they turned to ruin
And brought down their pain upon us


And I used to fight
For a living back then
But I found that life
Wasn't giving again
I once stood above people
I've bested before
It didn't feel real
I don't get my kicks out of war


And I always believed I would be different
I don't really know what but this sure isn't it
And I waste all my time wishing something would go my way
Moving on


Moving on
I can see where you're driving me too
All covered in heat playing characters beautiful
The street is a stage where we should've always been
Just marking the pavement with whatever comes out of our skin


OH lord forgive me
i forsake myself again
it came to me so simply
yet so simply i sinned


Oh God i need your help
i cant stop drawing myself
all my friends were down it
its ok if its ironic
please dont send me to hell
let me pray all day 
someway to help myself
help myself escape


yeah hes black on black on black on red
and he looks way better in my head 
i swear, everything is a mystery 
like why is he so damn edgy
but honestly hes kinda cool 
cant wait to show him off at school


Oh God I thank you
you gave me all i need
i no longer need to
identify with a drawing of me


Oh Lord you made me strong
i made quite the comeback
from a pitiful hedge hog
to a powerful man
but i was an animal
and so care free
i miss being what i was
i miss being me


i was black on black on black on red
and I look way better in my head 
got a big black sword that can kill
anything that I will
Oh my God Im just too cool
with a cape and a mask and a catchphrase too


but in the back of my mind 
I made a mistake
Somewhere along the line
i turned to something that was fake
it burns my insides
and it burns my skin it burns my face




When you saw the world fall
Did you care at all?
Did you keep flowing on
As you had done
For all these years?
Does the fate of man
Change your mighty course?
Did your winding paths cease
With the breaking of God's heart?
Or maybe you knew even then
Of the savior who would come
And so you stayed unchanged
With the plans of God


There is a whale inside my stomach and it's rummaging right through
All the acids and the toxins meant to break down all my food
And though ripples made were smaller than anything I ever knew
There's a whale inside my stomach and I can't stomach the news


There are people who want nothing more than to cause another pain
And then there are those who'd call these people evil and insane
And they shudder to know what's brewing in their brain
It's just humans stuck together it's just humans all the same


There is a stranger in my house and I can't help but feel unease
For paranoia and resentment replaced hospitality
And though I resent the growing danger with the changing of our seed
There's a stranger in my house and I'm still calling the police


We don't even know where this feeling's coming from
As we keel over in bed
And our heroes start to fall
To a pulse inside of them
There's no villain round the bend
There's no evil underground
We're alone after all
Just humans all around


There is an answer somewhere far away inside some dumb machine
Living it up and laughing while the world searches itself clean
Like we've had it once before and it's slipped away somehow
And everyone's embarrassed to say we've messed up out loud


There is a filter floating right between the sun and where we are
But no matter what we do it still keeps boiling our cars
And though the cold weather we long for hasn't wandered off too far
There are bitter feelings building up inside the nearest star




stand along the beach
and fan the flames
the sand and silt just tilts me
and it drives me insane
understand the the hand that gives
and gives you all you know
so stand along the beach
and fan the flames


dirty earth i plow my field
i reap what i sow
plant a tree and watch it peel
into something i don't know
understand the hand that gives
it lives in everything 
dirty earth i plow my field
i reap what i sow


to let go
refuse to let go
refuse to let go i choose 
to refuse to lose what i know


i choose to refuse to let go
refuse to let go
refuse to let go i choose 
to refuse to lose what i know
lose what I know




I cloned myself last saturday
And it looks like the clones are here to stay
I guess I’ll never be lonely
Cuz there ain’t one of me, there’s three
It seemed like a good idea at the time
But I guess I didn’t realize
All the problems I would create
Until they took shape


Like who gets the bed?
And who gets the couch?
And who’s sleeping in the tent in the backyard?
And whose clothes are these?
And well I guess they’re all of ours
Man, who knew living with yourself could be so hard?


I never knew I could be so annoying
And so myself, I’ve been avoiding
I’ve learned more about myself than I’d like
And I’ve even gotten into a few fights. 
Aside from the situation being so absurd,
I find that I keep gettin on my nerves
And one of my biggest fears
how I’m gonna pay for college next year


Is to clone yourself evil?
Is this an ethical problem?
I know I’ve done something crazy and that’s a fact
Is this even legal?
Have I committed a sin?
I don’t understand the theological ramifications of my act


We’ve already lost track 
of who the original was, and that’s back
But I think all of the men 
Are making this a normality 
Once we talked over things a bit
We started to get along real quick
And now I see the costs 
Are outweighed by the benefits


Like the constant friends
I’m always entertained 
And that I’ve started a band with just myself
We like the same things
And we play video games
This whole week I haven’t even seen anybody else




We all got the same problems
But we’re always there for eachother to solve ‘em
Now I can finally see
The only thing better than one of me is three
Now I’m chilling with my selves all day
And I couldn’t be happier, what can I say?
The fact that I like hanging out with myself the best
Is maybe proof that I’m a narcissist


It ain’t always easy
And we still have some fights
But at this point I’m very glad I don’t have a girlfriend 
Not everything’s breezy
But things end up alright
And cloning yourself is something that I’d recommend




What comes flying through your house
Spinning round itself
Always aligned with the time
And just pushing us closer to something we brokered


Just distract from the shove
Burying our love
Joking about folds that we see
And the lines in the skin in the face between you and me


I didn't react when we met
Just like they said
And all I could hear were the taunts
And the laughter of small kids who thought that I'd lost it


I'm not somebody's game
I'm nothing you say
All but a mirror on legs
Proudly wed to the image reflected to anyone's gaze


I know that you'll try to find meaning when I'm gone
But there is nothing now and there'll be nothing later on
So long as you refuse to see
The broken glass stuck underneath


It seems I'm running out of steam
But don't give up the dream
I'm just so proud of the seed flowering beneath
And this secret I keep won't be coming after me
When I finally get sleep bittersweet all they'll see
Is a pile of skin and nothing more to believe in


do the yourself a favor 
if your sick of having neighbors
i suggest that you invest in 
IEDs so that ur neighbors DIE


i can sense something aint right
i feel some anger in my mind
some goober thinks that he can take 
what he wants and that i wont break his spine


i dont think for too long i do what i feel
so take apart this song and debate what is real
you'll catch me in a corner screaming the opposite of what I'm meaning
but im this close to seeing it all through 


i will never be upset again
i will never be upset
i will never be upset again
i will never hurt my friends
i will never blow up again
and risk the shrapnel break your skin 


do the world a favor 
since amazon exploits its labor
i encourage that you research
how to make IEDs so they lose their money


Where’s the soul hiding?
Tell me now or I will go
Dying
You promised me something


Where’s the battle cries?
I wanna see the good guys fight
The bad side
Don’t tell me you’ve been lying


Where’s the big moment?
If you’re gonna sell me a story
Then own it
Stop boring me with these


Vague apocalyptic endings
I need some real shit and
Fictions not enough for me now
I’m turning animal
I need to get out of this place somehow
I need Yellowstone to surround me
In its warm embrace


Where’s the good sleeping?
Where’s some good food when you need it?
I want the good life benefits back


Where’d my friends all go?
I wouldn’t mind if I didn’t know
Before
Now life’s turned such a bore


Now the worlds falling
I didn’t expect the end to be so
Boring
I want a fight or a war or a


Vague apocalypse depiction
The rich are fishing for some
Thing akin to Para](lel’s sound
But I’m not loud enough
I gotta get out of this place somehow
I need Yellowstone to surround me
In its warm embrace


Where’s the grown men crying?
I need everyone to know
I’m tryingI met a girl from the world of Maine
And she wouldn't say her name
To save her life or to save mine
So I crashed my plane
Into her house
Into her house and we both died


She wouldn't show her face to me
For reasons that were insane to me
And reasonably I reasoned that she should die
And questionably I questioned my peace of mind


The boys I knew and loved kissed a flame
They burnt their tongues before they moved away
But they laughed it off and said I'm joining them as well
So we laughed it off and laughed our way to hell
We laughed it off and laughed our way to hell


We burnt all our favorite faces
Oh we burnt all of our outer shells
By the time we burnt through all the places
We got to know each other pretty well


This robot is lonely, like me
And like me, he doesn’t want to admit it
This robot prefers simplicity
He doesn’t like for his emotions to get too complicated 
This robot is selfish, like me
He often tramples over others’ feelings
This robot believes that he shouldn’t have nice things
But still he runs after them so desperately


This robot lives inside a small, secluded house because the outside world is too cold
This robot has a fiery, fragile beating heart that he needs someone else to hold


This robot gets older everyday
But inside he still feels the same
This robot hates feeling pain
So he’ll think about it until it goes away


This robot often has trouble recognizing his own emotional needs 
This robot can’t help it if he likes to look at beautiful things


This robot has many good friends
But sometimes he likes to pretend
That no one is there to comfort him
And that he’s living all alooooone


This robot is loved so much by those that he knows
And if he understood that well, he might explode


This robot is lonely, like me
And like me, he has a way to fix it
This robot prefers simplicity
But he’ll be alright if his emotions to get too complicated


I walk this path almost every day
I have no passion but what can I say?
I've lived this house so many years
A paradise devoid of fears
And every building especially made
To keep reality at bay


I think the house goes far beyond the foundations
It's all over this nation
A picture perfect sun to soak
Behind branch ceilings made of great oak
As the light struggles to shine through the leaves up above
What's not to love?


I always thought that paradise could never exist
But it's locked behind years of debt and monthly interest


But this suburban dream's been haunting me like nothing else
Bright skies, bike races, and a big old house
It's like someone wants to change my luck
But that's enough
I'm through with that stuff


This family's got things to cover
It's own story like every other
I wish that I could end it here
Another bloodline disappears
But there's nothing to grieve anyway
For the neighborhood spits out children every day


Soak these sins away in chlorine water
Hide behind my mother and father
Who lock out all the dangerous things
While subsequently keeping some in
Just like the sitcoms I would watch as a child
Every house a hundred pages long in its own personal file


Paints a beautiful picture every season
Of attractive, happy folk and they're all white for some reason


But this suburban dream's been costing me for far too long
Bank loans, garden gnomes, there's something wrong
It's like something's trying to change my life
But that's alright
It's just not my type


I'm like a fish in the ocean
But I walk on the grass
I'm dumb as rocks
And I couldn't be asked
To swim somewhere new
And hope for the best


And my first mistake
Was thinking about it


Think think about fish
And and the next dish
Please please make me feel
A little more real


Soak soak up my soul
With a sponge and soap
Please please make me feel
A little more real


I put in the effort but I wasn't rewarded
I just got fucked but I won't report it
I'm pretty sure no one would listen
I know I wouldn't


Think think about fish
And and the next dish
Please please make me feel
A little more real


Soak soak up my soul
With a sponge and soap
Please please make me feel
A little more real


Eyy, pots and pans pots and pans! Eye!


Pots and pans, pots and pans
I don’t think you quite understand
If you really were the man
You’d drive away in a minivan
Better read that Quran
And cook up some pecans
Cuz this song has just began
And pots n pans are in demand
Pots and pans are Biblical
Just like in Ezekiel
It may be untraditional
But we’re psychoanalytical
Pots n pans I’m invincible
Try not to be so cynical
The pots n pans are not minimal
Sirens cuz this beat is criminal


(Eyy, pots and pans, pots and pans)
(Eyy, you’re the man, pots and pans)
(Pots and pans, they go bang)
(Eyy, pots and pans)
(Eyy, lets go pots and pans)
(Eyy, pots and pans)
(They go bang, in a tin can)
(I’m a trash can, Eyy)


Pots and Paaaaaans!
Pots and Paaaaaans!


Well just send me to someplace else
I bid everyone a good farewell
Except you cuz I know you're coming too
Passing through every town we find
Laughing for the whole damn drive
On the planet's deeper side


We left everyone we've known
And all the stupid little things we used to own
The sun sets and I close my eyes
I'll be sleeping here in this car ride
And everything's going alright
On the planet's deeper side


Oh I hope
This road goes in circles
No more hurdles in life
Just the drive


I can't even read this fucking map in front of me
Couldn't even read my old worst enemies
I don't even want to look behind me
I don't need something else reminding me
There's no tether on my ankle
There's no anchor on my mind
Just the highway and some album
And just feel so alive
We are blind to all your strife
Nobody can strike this metal
Just pedal to the planet's deeper side


Look up ahead
Take life as it comes to you instead
Keep your eyes on the road
Don't you leave me alone
Oh I hope
This road goes in circles
No more hurdles in life
Just the drive


Oh I hope
This road goes in circles
No more hurdles in life
Just the drive


It starts out like this,
swimming in the void called your head.


Closing the doors, and layin' in bed,
to try and make somethin' from nothin'.


and it's impossible to see the end, but just hold your breath
for longer
'til you
totally drown
lifelessly 
tumbling to the deep
'til y'hit rock bottom.


You could fit the world in one hand
And crush it like playground sand
Between your fingers and in your mind
Watching the rings around your eyes
Grow darker with the passage of time
Make sure to stay awake for the rest of your life


We can throw out the trash and
Throw our body bags
At each other every day
Until we have nothing to say
But you're just a kid with your noise
Not half bad for a couple lonely boys


But you have to understand
That you can't live without your other half


Like a match to gasoline
Like a match to gasoline
Like a match to gasoline
Like a match to gasoline


There's a fly in my room
And if he doesn't get out soon
I'm gonna punch my walls
Why is he so small?


The animal kingdom
Came down to frown on our wisdom
I don't
Really know what that means


You'll find someone I swear
I swear to God I gotta get these bugs outta my hair


And it buzzes like a fly
And he will buzz until you die
It will buzz until you die
It will buzz until you die



Raise your staff
Strike the sea
Enter the Nile
It won’t mean a thing


Break through chains
Kill with bones
Topple pillars
Can’t do it on your own


Sling your stone
Fight your wars
You’re no ruler
Without the Lord
Kill your giants
Run from kings
Give it all back
To the one who is holy


Prophecy 
Tame the lion
But don’t forget where 
Your gifts come from


Holy of Holies
Sacrifice
Golgotha
Where you paid the price
Sweat and blood
We cost your life
Can’t you see it all
Points to Christ?


Such a pretty thing
You shape the tint of rose
On the glasses that I wear
You move so easily
Like you're more than we know
And you can fly up in the air
Such a perfect thing
And life would be much easier if I didn't look this way
But it's too late


You've crawled outta test tubes and software code
When the rivers dry and the rocks erode
You'll still be here laughing at my grave
But not before the focus group gives the okay


So come now crawl this way
While I still have a say
Simple and ravishing
Whatever's happening


If only I could have a chance at the world like some mold
The awful beautiful crazy things I'd do before I'm old


But it's just a glance at you
A form of symmetry
Nobody could emulate
You're too good to be true
It's almost disgusting
How it puts us all to shame
You're corporate comfort food
I know it all too well but I still can't stop the crave
Cuz it's too late


If I were you I'd drown in pride
Cuz I'd be laughing stealing everybody's eye
I'd still be here long after they're dead
And the world'll be covered in all the skin I've shed


Come now talk to me
Take that faithful leap
The sun is blackening
Whatever's happening
Come now crawl this way
While I still have a say
Simple and ravishing
Whatever's happening




i couldnt find my toothpaste this morning
i hope you dont mind that i 
couldnt help been blind
i wish i wasn't
so flawlessly flawed in so many places
but lets face it its normal for me 
so unobtrusive so inoffensive
i hate it


sometimes in the sky the planets align
and we get to feel what feeling is like
but at the end of the day
we'll stay the same
cuz change is for losers
anyway


i spilled all the toothepaste out on purpose
im sorry i can be a bit of an ass
but im getting sick of apologizing
because frankly i didn't ask


cant wipe the white hairs off
and its wearing onto me


sometimes we can stop our thoughts
from invading this pretty place i bought
but in case you need some help 
ask someone else
cuz at the end of the day
well stay the same
and hopefully we'll be okay






So when the air grows colder
The colors fade in fall
Feels like a weight off my shoulders
Like I don't have any at all


When it comes with rain
The glory days are gone
Something I can't explain
Maybe something beyond


If I'm always lower
Than where I want to be
Then why would I try to get
Any higher than me?


If we're growing closer
Our own family tree
This is what I want the most
You're always happy


And we road trip to some 20 acre plot where we will stay
Just pretending like humanity is planets away
And we grow old and fade without so much as a footnote to our name


And we're showing cracks
In the space between our hair
And someday we'll fall and crash
And mesh right then and there


And our brains will uncoil
And start their slithering
Into what's left of the boys
We're beautiful and ugly


I see the lights of a hospital where the old folks will go
When the younger all decide that they're clumsy and slow
And we all seem alright with dying at the end of the same road


If we're never knowing
What's up above or below
Well then we're always throwing
Just try to let go


If it's if then statements
You're trying to deduce
Then add an else there somewhere
Until it comes true


If I can't see what lives inside of me


You're not on a rocket ship, headed for outer space
You're a time traveler from the past
getting ready to watch your last blast


As you fly into the sky, the people cried and said goodbye
instead of jumping out for joy
But you can't breathe too loud
lest the universe will implode
or slowly settle into entropy


It's a shame but even the same you knew
Never really comes back to you...


-break


As everything just starts to fade
don't keep looking out the rocket the very thing that they don't want you to do
enter the spirals pocket the familiar just goes away
Leaving nothing but you


That's the bit you'll tell yourself
That's the thing you knew well
Only because you saw the future
That was bright
You're sure now, that that's right
You're sure now, it's okay! its fine


-break


The world is wide, the world is deep
Jump in the whirlpool and let it seep
Into your bones
Yes the frame you happen to own


Let the SALT get in your skin
Let the water swish within
bubbly wubbly tubbly mess
is one of the very best
Feelings




They say that there's nothing in outer space
But I don't believe them
Cuz there's nothing in this place
Either


I just want to be your lover
She screamed at the sky
Watching the stars dance above her
The sight just made her cry


Either way I'll see you
Fly off outta the room
And soar past me
And skate off the moon


I just want to be your brother
But I have yet to greet you
Now we are just like each other
And now it's time to eat you


They say that there's nothing in outer space
But I don't believe them
Cuz there's nothing in this place
And I can't shake the feeling
That there's something wrong
Walk down the street
And everybody else is gone


Either way we'll
Be far away
From each other but
At least you're here today




Holding out my hand
Hoping someone will take it
If all I can feel is the air
Doesn’t that make me worthless?


Close my eyes and dream a
World where no one hates me
Close my eyes and I still
Feel like something’s missing


Have I ever really loved someone else?
Can I look past the endless sea of myself?
As you lift me up I rip out your spine
I take as much as I can before I die
Gasping for air through the holes in my teeth
I’m drowning, in my desires I’m steeped 
As I’m covered in spines and sick with disease I think
How could you hold one like me?


How can we be looking at the same thing
And see them so differently 
After you wipe the dirt off my face
I turn around and spit on your grave


And you always welcome me home 
Even after I say I’ll never return
It’s something I won’t understand 
You love every bit of what I am


And if I’ve ever really loved someone else
It’s with you I can look past the sea of myself
As you lift me up I rip out your spine
But you smile and tell me you’re still alright
Gasping for air through the holes in my teeth
I’m drowning, in my desires I’m steeped 
As I’m covered in spines and sick with disease I think
Thank you for holding someone like me!




Don't open your door at night
Or else it will come in
disgusting fluttering wings
With a bite that pierces your skin
And flight of impossible speed


It scales the walls
seeking you out with it superhuman vision
It's OUT TO SUCK YOUR BLOOd


The dreadful terror of the night,
Flying darkness what a fright
You can dispel it with a special light
But is it to your left or to your right
You'll never know...
It'll plague you for the rest of the night


You hear it once again, singing its seductive tune
You try to run but it'll catch up to you quickly
It's too fast! It's too evasive!
and inescapable!


You flail around! To escape the mosquito!




caught huffing the fumes of your car
in the parking lot thats way too far away
we cant escape this place
no matter how hard you try


no matter how hard you try
you can never fly
to where you wanna be
theres always someone who wont let you pass
theres always someone whos gotta ask


where you going where you from
where you going where you from
where you going where you from
why be smart when you can be dumb


i used to feel better 
but now im sick as fuck
but i don't remember
I think its amnesia


i used to be better
but now im sick as fuck
they treat me like a leper
and thats just my luck


and they say
where you going where you from
dont you chase the sun
where you going where you from
dont you go off and run
where you going where you from
where you going where you from
where you going where you from
why be smart when you can be dumb


Darkness lurking underneath your bed
There’s a skull just sitting in your head
I guess that you could say
In its own sort of way
Things are kinda getting really spooky


In your dreams
You can never run away cuz
In your dreams
You are always moving through 
Molasses
The fastest
You can move
Won’t do
Heeheeheehee!


Spiders making webs up in the trees
Worms crawling unseen beneath your feet
I guess that you could say
In its own sort of way
Things are kinda getting really spooky


Though you try your very best
Tonight you’ll find you cannot rest
Lying here you feel so stressed
For tomorrow you have a math test


Darkness lurking all around your bed
There’s a skull still grinning in your head
It seems that you could say 
In its own sort of way
Things are kinda getting really spooky


Well this silvery night


It calls for some beating
And this silvery spike
It longs for a reason






And I long for reprieve


And something comes over me


No I'll never let you breathe




When it spills out your skin
This pain is unusual
Blood flow within


The organs were beautiful


Untainted as is


Machinery working towards
Sweaty with spit
And gushing each strum of the chord




And I finally feel
When others feel numb in the abyss
Where others will reel
I've never felt happy like this






Don't be afraid of the grave
I'll be with you on that day


I'll be good to my prey






And with each newborn scar


You're bony and brutal
With all that you are
I'll paint you a mural


With the front of my car


Or slippery slits


From the arteries within


You spread yourself too thin




All that I need


Is bloody and brutal


The villagers weep
The sweet daughter's funeral
Too tearful to see


There's much more to reap
I'm so sorry to be


But what's inside will soon set me free


Don't remind me of where we all live
I know we should move but my father won't give
What's the point of those that we keep?
It could strike any moment in our sleep


Troubled homes
Broken folk
Where once we ruled
Now we roam
And the screams
Every night
Never flinch
Let it dine


When the moon isn't bright
In a shoebox shaped spine
Keep your eyes full
Keeping guard without reason or rhyme
Smell the stench from beyond the tree line
These beautiful woods don't belong to mankind
But mother and father couldn't hold down their rage
The beast won them over and beasts they became
And not one night would pass with no hunter's attack
I'd wake up not knowing if my parents came back


Keep your children in bed every night
The curious tend to go losing their lives
Life just feels like fear on repeat
It could strike any moment in our sleep


And I grow
All alone
What's outside
Still unknown
Troubled folk
Broken homes
Broken limbs
Bloody bones


Cuz my parents once tried
And I lost them that night
Heard the beast cry
Felt the grief that will last for some time
Oh their pieces just scattered throughout
My heart would soon follow with each cry and each shout
They'd wake up the children of murdered adults 
And soon I could feel the curse taking hold
And I'd try to get sleep but it calls out for me
And I'd dream of its hide at my feet


We used to pile up snow deep in the woods we used to know
But people think the world has become marred
I'd be one to agree but they ignore it blatantly
As if there isn't some kind of beast in our backyard


But I went out one night
And I got pretty far
Took some shortcuts
Took some cuts that will probably scar
On my dead dad's head I swear to you, fiend
I'll bury your hide before All Hallow's Eve


A roar rattles through our windows
I couldn't even see my own two hands
What a beautiful meadow
What I wouldn't give to take back this land


Far out in the east
Deeper than deep
You can still hear the hunter's faint screams


So!
Wake up the widows of murdered young men
Who came to an end in the beast's bloody den
The feelings of fear overcome their vengeance
For no one can stop the animal's engine
But all bitter things have to pass on someday
Our children will find you when we're old and grey
Somewhere crawling on all fours with a name that isn't yours
You'll be dead at my door someday soon






I'll use my fingers to set you aside
Gouge your stomach and take what's mine
Alone in my head, alone with friends
Bones in places where flesh should be instead
I can speak for hours at a time
You can watch and see if you like


There's so many things wrong with this picture
Some awful being, some unholy figure
I'll bend your halo into a spiral
Break mirrors with my face
Turn into something else


She made you take all of me
Awkwardly hollering
All the things I wanted to be
If it wasn't for all the times
I recall on the fly
I would go insane


There's so many things wrong with this picture
Some awful being, some unholy figure
I'll bend your halo into a spiral
Break mirrors with my face
Turn into something else






You’re burning the CHOW!


Can you read with me the letters of the moon?
While we watch the clock run dry, this couldn’t end too soon
It could be worse, it could be better than it was back then
Ooh, what did I say, what did I say people? Didn’t I say that this game was for children?


Wait a minute, I’m amazing.


So break your heart with the waves
Against the rocks of your face
And the water in your hands,
It trickles through the your fingers with your faith
You voice like honey in my ears
Though I can’t taste what I can hear
But all I know is that I’ve got to have you near


Hey, we’re home!
What a good vacation.
The best vacation! 
I agree with you.
I knew you’d agree! You know a lot about vacations.
Oh, you are so nice!
It’s easy to be nice to YOU!


I really should stop trying to hope
There's nothing that I want to know
But soon this world stands in my way
There won't be time to sing and play
And something may come after death
But I'm not one to hold my breath
It brings me closer every hour
So go ahead and cry out coward
Cuz I wished so hard that I could believe
In a god so strong and kindly


Humble and all receiving
Friend, I found your peace receding down your spine
It took two of me
And this whole damn company


Ripe with plain indifference
You rid yourself of your fingerprints
Believe there's nothing left to you
Like you aren't making something new
The day this family quiets down
Is a day I won't be coming round
I only wonder what it means
The lives that I live in my dreams
And somehow everybody hopes
It's buried deep in home videos
Behind the happy family veil
Back when we slept in our cradle
I wish this pain would somehow morph
Into beauty known for all its worth


Fine skin and pretty flowing
Hair that just keeps growing to their final days
It isn't the same
When will something go my way?


Family members point and laugh
At the charred remains of my second half
And Grandad preps the evening stew
We throw that shit away next noon
But why did they come crawling back?
Our savings drain when they turn to ash
On some vague, religious, darkened day
We throw that shit into the lake
I couldn't keep myself contained
I've kept this face 1000 days
My soul is broken, marred and stained
My little brother, still charred remains
She said, "I wanna look back at how happy
We all would try to pretend to be


So smile now, the camera's rolling"
Where have I been going wrong this past decade?
This isn't okay
I had so much more to say


The weather’s cold but I got my hot chocolate
No need for milk, just water it’s flawless
All warm in my expensive metal goblet
Don’t try to hate,
Tengo liquid gold, chocolate




things are a little uncomfy
but so much a something too something
I have so much to do
but some things I can't see them through
in an endless world
I'm not a barbie girl
I'm not alone
Shout out to my bros!


Sweet lips of mine on the mountain top
Ate apple pie get over the troughs
I've seen enough, yeah I've been through a lot
Dream her lips on mine on the mountain top
And out on the porch with our warm drinks
We didn't really do much of anything
With our hands on our eyes let the heat sink
Back into our spines as we sip our warm drinks


And you don't have to be
Somewhere in between
Travel back and forth
Let me go to sleep
I will see you tomorrow
I will see you on the hour
Let our worlds collide
And let your fields flower


Sink your teeth in there's a lot to chew
All the people here with their brown colored shoes
They don't matter to me but they do to you
We haven't forgotten


And in the middle of the night
I will be inside
In the blood colored sheets
And right between your eyes
I will be here tomorrow
I will be here tonight
Let the worlds collide
And watch the birds taking flight




Oh angel in the moon
Will you be coming soon?
Will you be crying on our soil
Let nature fertilize
Let the air sterilize
Oh won't you wrap this town in foil


A trilogy's ending
With each plot we kept in
Each spinoff is shelving
It just wasn't selling


But you were a dead dog years ago
Now you're much more than I've ever known
Capillary webs and bones will flow
Away through the water down below


Oh company
Don't let go of me
And I won't let you get run down
By that evil skin
That just keeps pedaling
It grinds our flesh into the ground


Let cartoon characters gather for their soft and simple songs
If everyone would rather leave the stale reruns on
Someday my eyes will roll back to a warmer place and I'll
Never have to know


But you were a good ghoul years ago
Now you're a martyr no one knows
All that you were was faintly thrown
Away to the water down below


And on brighter days, I'd rather stay under the sheets
Believe that all your words are metaphors for the silver scene
But the prouder half keeps shouting that you sing to me
Lovely and lost in letters like the widest eyes alive
Should want to be


But you were a symbol years ago
Now your mother calls you home
All I believed was faintly thrown
Out where the broken songs will go
Leak all your legends down your lobe
Wade through the water down below


Wade through the water down below


His little treads are worn and done
"later" they said 
the rust slowing down his morning run
"greener" they said 


the sun spirals up ahead
eternal tan for free
light stains the lead
broken expectations


do your tasks 


he dreams of smoke to cover the sun
he dreams of no arms to reduce their weight to none 


He doesn't wanna close his eyes but they're heavy
"hey man" they said
He sees something white and shiny
"now" they said


"oh man what a trooper, stay in there bud we're finally home "




Somewhere out there there’s someone
To comfort me when I feel low
She’ll hold me tight all night long and say
“I’ll never let you go.”


Somewhere out there there’s someone
That I won’t ever deserve
But I guess until I meet her 
I’ll just post sad pictures of anime girls


I saw her again last night in my dream
My cares melted away as she gave me a hug
They say guys only want one thing
But it might be two, acceptance and love


Posting more pictures of her
And you ask me, “are you good bro?”
As my loneliness creeps in closer
I realize the answer is always ”no”


Somewhere out there there’s a girl
Who’ll leave me totally amazed
Somewhere out there there’s a girl
That isn’t underaged


Somewhere out there there’s a tomboy
That’ll fall deep in love with me
Ok but unironically 
That would be great
Please 
God


Sad anime girls are what I need
As they love me unconditionally 
But as much as I wish
A girl that’s perfect simply can’t exist


These sad anime girls that I see
Are the projections of what I want her to be
And as my expectations for her soar
I wonder if I’ll be happy with a real girl anymore


Somewhere out there there’s someone
That’s just a sad human like me




Late Christmas Eve was bliss and calm
But maybe not as much as I remember
When the callous hand gave redder skin
And the shedding starts and bleeding
And I loved every moment
Cuz I lived with the demon
So much redder than I've ever been
Living in a house of sin


You
Are something I can't tolerate and
You
Are me


Late Christmas Eve we'll fall asleep
And dream of skin much cleaner than these floors
The vanilla scent and sweat pours our your pores
No callous hands come striking anymore


You
Are something I can't tolerate and
You
Are me


You
Are something I have never seen and
You
Are me






Cheaply made, but that's nothing new for you
The floors unstable but what can you do, except for stand there


Lose yourself in the old dinosaur bones
Soon you're standing still all alone.


Touch your hardened skin, feel within
That your insides are too settled


The plastic parts are driving you insane




I don’t wanna clean my room
Get rid of all my stuff
For the move, and then find out I
Still have too much stuff in my room


I don’t wanna go to school
And learn about things that make me drool
Cuz I fell asleep in class again
I should’ve gone to bed earlier last night


I don’t wanna cut my hair
But if I don’t it gets everywhere
Like in my eyes and in the shower drain
What a pain


I just wanna walk away
But to where I just can’t say
I just wanna run away
With you, and maybe you too


I don’t wanna put that beanie into a box
And then move the box to another city
And then take the beanie
Back out of the box


I don’t wanna go to school
But I have to get a degree to be a missionary 
And then I’ll go to Thailand or somewhere else
That would be cool


I don’t wanna cut my hair
But I wanna look like Prince Caspian
From the Disney movie that I watched
Except I’ll never be that hot


I just wanna drive away
But to where I just can’t say
I just wanna fly away
With you, and maybe you too


That was me
After a while
I'm just too good hiding behind my smile
Though I should shiver in the cold
I could never do just as I'm told


And it was you
I sang this song for
And you gladly took the offer
Though it's hardly worth the effort
So beat this song until it's tender


Oh this beat's so empty
Oh this beat's so fucking empty


And after every loose connection
I just look behind my eyes
Hoping there's something kinda interesting
To project into this life
Oh beat me down again
I promise you someday
There'll be no pills left to swallow
Or singers left to praise


It was me
You wore a smile for
But it felt so unreliable
Though it may seem I've come the farthest
I couldn't tell you where I started


And it was you
I bawled my eyes out
Realized how much I missed you
I watched the last bastion of people
Shoot their hopes like missiles to heal your world's wounds


Oh it feels so fucking empty
Oh these words so fucking empty


And after every friend's embrace
I just brace for the next blow
It always feels too late
To try and love but I don't know
Oh beat me down again
If life only gets harder
With every bruise I'm blessed with
Every flinch only gets smaller


Oh beat me down again
I guess it's just the same
Whether we make it or the world ends
There's no difference anyway




Give me a call
I don't even see you at all
Your voice was once tall
What happened, what happened, what happened


The sight of this place
It just makes my mind race
I don't need somebody to lead
I'll wallow with you
When your mind turns to glue
If only you'd land on your feet


The songs that go on
I couldn't dream so honestly
Tell me what's wrong
My heads so far deep in the leaves of the fall


You haven't grown up at all


And I wrote you a song
To try and make you see
But I might need you more than you need me
I couldn't dream so honestly
All of my wishes just mesh on repeat
I wished I could sleep when I finally leave
And if it caves in on me, well how hard can it be?


Nothing but frozen white 
Cold til his fingers fall


Gentle prayer for warmth
Just a little bit


Feel the urge to stand tall
Nothing but snow for so far


Doesn't even know where he is 


Here, hold, fast
Peer through the hole to the past
And then say a prayer


"Just a little bit.
Thanks for the strength to stand tall
There's nothing but snow so far"




And the tears drop
And the snow falls
Into the ground


Another's stopped his singing


And I stop believing
The screen's no longer ringing


And the house is heaving




A voice inside is rambling
And the world is hanging on its words


And we don't get to rest
Just listening to all it says, it says




"Could you turn the screws inside to something right?
I'm not myself I'm not myself tonight"
The world's too loud






And I could've sworn we all were praying to something deep inside the moon


There must be reason


You're leaving so soon
There's a lion in every mouse
There's history in this house


There's always something going on underground






And after all the beating
My heart tries beating louder
I ask for some sorta meaning
But they're the prouder ones






And soon you'll all be leaving
Hoping there's no dreck


And I'll be stuck here singing


All the things he says






"I see the time where mom and I had our first fight
My brain is full my brain is full tonight"
Break me out




And I know there's something that my friends won't tell me just to keep me happy
Where is the meaning?
Underneath all this crap
There's resentment in your spouse
There's history in this house


There's always something going on underground






I see the two of us taking our final drive


I'm wide awake I'm wide awake tonight
There's a secret you won't let out
There's history in this house
There's always something speaking for the Sound




Gotta make a song
About singing along
Everyone is
Everyone isn't


I don't know where to go
I don't know who I am
Where it goes


And you are
A superstar
Kick the bones
And take em home
Eat em up
Like a pizza


I made a bomb
I hid it in your garage
That was serious
I hope you find it
Cuz it would suck if you died
It would suck


Out comes the wake up call
Out calls a wayward squall
And all the crystals weighing down the trees
The world is bliss while the sun's too hard to see
And I know
You believe me too
If you go
Can I leave with you?


Icicle trees
Like dandelions in the lazy light
I don't know why
Candy lies and says we'll be alright


And she wraps the twine round
Every inch of skin
Breathe in your willows
Your will to stand gives in
I can't move anything
I can go anywhere
I can be anything


I was BORN ready for this! 
Not so fast, Janet! I’LL be the star of the show!
Hey, maybe we can focus?
(Let’s not screw this one up, guys)
3, 2, 1, GO!!


Welcome back my friends!
To a place where the sunshine never ends.
Wait, I thought that was just a dumb name?
It is, but it’s part of a marketing campaign.


If you’ve been looking to save some dough,
We want you to know,
That our prices are at an all time low.
Our rates are better than ever before! 
But the quality’s the same, you can rest assured!


The instrumental break begins!
I think this is going pretty good so far!
Will we get raises after this?
I really don’t get paid enough.
Money? I’m doing this for the glory!
You would be.
(And, action!)


Our company is about to be broke!
This weekend promo is our only hope!
And if we don’t sell all our product in the next 48 hours, we’ll lose our jobs.
Wait, what?


So when your life is rough,
When you don’t feel you’re enough,
When you’re really really stuck in a muck,
Then remember us, it’ll be just fine!
(Come on, guys)
It’s SunnyShine!
(Industries)




Sweet summer warmth weighing down my skin
And all the things I'm carrying
Know that plate of gears never was your friend
We're better off than we were back then
Please please


We'll save you room underneath the moon
Make sure there is nobody for miles around
This body's sound burdening and loud
Where are we to go if it were idle?


I've been told there's nobody to blame
But I could never entertain that


Oh the animals that want to come and play
And they don't ever go away
Hoping some sweet stranger sees and the calm comes over me
I need to know
I need


Remember Cain blowing out his brains?
I don't think he could if he was Abel
Lockup guard piercing through my arm
Which one of us is the most ungrateful?


I've been told you're steady with your fist
And I don't think I could resist this


Which one of us is the most ungrateful?




It’s the end of an age
Buildings falling down unto the pavement
Below as cracks appear
Swallowing us whole to who knows where
It’s the end of the human race
Everyone’s dying to get to the next place
Yet as the world falls apart I’ve never felt so free
For this will not be the end of me!


Take my arm
By the sleeve
Hold my heart
Just believe
There’s nothing that
We can’t achieve
The future is for you and me!


It’s the end of an age
But don’t worry ‘bout me, I won’t change
Cuz growing up is just a myth
And not something that I’d bother with


It’s the end of an era
But I don’t care-a, I’m more concerned with what comes after that
The new era’s coming fast
The old era’s just in the past!


Take my arm
By the sleeve
Hold my heart
Just believe
There’s nothing that
We can’t achieve
The future is for you and me!


So!


Take my arm
By the sleeve
Hold my heart
Just believe
There’s nothing that
We can’t achieve
The future is for you and me!


When all is settled in the world
I just want us buried in our curls
And if I come back to you, come back to me






And if that rolling sun comes in


Like it did so many times since spring


You need to sing out to me, I'll sing out to you




So pretty, these memories


I'm looking for navy skies and glowing eyes


I just want to bring you up


Break some backbones if we must




You need to sing out to me, I'll sing out to you, something new






I will be there next to you


I will see you sometime soon


There will be a next time too


I don't need to be your moon


Just know that I love you




Stare into the mirror
But don’t answer the beast


Stare until you make it weep


Don’t tell yourself not to cry


Hold my hand and we’ll stay ’till the end of time!


Here I’ll stay
Every day
It has to be this way
It’s gonna be okay


How can we be looking at the same thing? I think
Honey please, I need the kids
And ooh I just wanna write like this


The blood always lets
Some things I’ll never get
Like when these things are over
Can’t see the end of it
Let’s get together
And do it all oh my
We’re forever friends


The blood always lets
Some things I’ll never get
Like when these things are over
Can’t see the end of it
Let’s get together
And do it all oh my
We’re forever friends


And we’ll stay ‘till the end of time
And we’ll stay ‘till the end of time


And we stand on shoulders of giants
And we eat from orchards on their hands
Take my hand
Here we’ll stand
Against the cold


I was hit by a car it was made of debris
you threw a cat at the door and named it after me
and stabbed with a knife i was able to fly
let my blood pour out to paint the world as mine
to take whats mine


you crawled on the grass layin next to me 
and smiled at the ceiling with gritted teeth
who's smiling now


card trick
you seen it before
you dropped it 
and picked it off the floor


shake my hand
and and break us in two
you take us apart 
like theres an earthquake in you


and naturally as the old sky splits
it speaks of clouds and the rain it spits
and nothing else 
and nothing else
and nothing else
except itself

It is a special day in the kingdom of Aragu. Citizens are running about in an excited hurry. Something is happening today that has not happened in quite some time: The King of Aragu is delivering a royal proclamation. 
 
 
Have you heard the news?
Of course, I don’t live under a rock.
There’s going to be a proclamation today!
Why, we haven’t had one of those in forever.
But, what do you think it’ll be about?
Yeah, I don’t really keep up with politics.
This is the most exciting thing to happen all year!
We need more interesting lives...
 
The king is going to make an announcement today
The kingdom’s all in a buzz
I just don’t get all this fuss
The thing that’s on all our minds I trust is
What will he say?
What will he say?
 
The king is going to make an announcement today
It won’t be about anything bad, I pray
We’ll miss it soon, we gotta go!
Time is moving way too slow
The one thing we all want to know is
What will he say?
What will he say?
 
C’mon, can’t it happen already?
 I’m so excited, I’m getting all sweaty!
You could’ve kept that to yourself…
Hey, it’s not something I can help! 
Oooh, the King is so attractive!
I hope he doesn’t raise the taxes…
Quiet now, here he comes!
 Oh, this is so much fun!
 
The King’s announcement is happening today
And now it’s time to hear what he will say
 
 
His royal highness, King Emon Herbet!
 
It is my duty to inform you that it is once again time 
For a member of the most esteemed Herbet line
To embark upon a most dangerous quest 
To put their strength, wits, and courage to the test. 
To claim, from the tallest peak of Mountain Ergo,
A royal jewel to prove that they are worthy of the throne.
So now, may I present to you, the hero of our kingdom, 
My royal heir, your favorite Prince, Ime Herbet, my Son. 
 
 
Today, he will begin his journey to the throne. Soon, he will not be known as “Ime the Prince,” but as “Ime the King.” (applause)
 
It is as I’ve said, son. You must journey to the top of Mount Erego. There, you will find a tri-colored jewel: it is the right of the family of Herbet to rule the kingdom. Bring this back, and you will fulfill your destiny of becoming the king of Aragu. 
Thanks, Dad. The jewel’s as good as mine.  I’ll make you proud.
I know, son. Now, go! Your destiny awaits!
(cheering)
 
 
The young prince Ime sets off towards the Mountain of Erego as fast as his feet will take him. Before long, the sounds of the cheering citizens of Aragu fade into the distance, and excitement fills the heart of the young prince.
 
Adventure leaps from all around
Listen close to hear the sound
But Father, I will not let you down


I’ll Climb the highest mountain top
Cross the widest sea
There’s no limit to what I can achieve! 


Because I can do anything!
I can do anything!


Feel the rush of the air
Flying past all my cares
How I feel that it’s calling me somewhere!


Generations have past
It comes to me at last
And all of them I will surpass


My heart beats faster as I journey into the unknown
This is my mark upon the world, and I’ll do it on my own!


Because I can do anything!
I can do anything!
I can do anything!
I can do anything!




A hopeful mantra as Prince Ime Herbet flies like the wind towards the ever looming Mount Erego. What challenges will he encounter? What mysteries lie ahead? Find out next time on Ime the Prince.






I woke up with a headache like nobody ever knew
CD shards and stencil designs washing over you
And the floor was way too far away for me to drop my feet
I'll have to take the leap but for now we'll go back to sleep


I want to tell you all the ways you graze the air when you play your waves
But you already know you already know


And I won't let go your remains
And I can't be bothered to change


So simple sticks the state of days
So many ways to lose you
But I know better now
So live with me or someone else
Let's find a house and find out how
We grow out of this hell
Into something I don't know


You think it starts and ends and starts again when the lyric finally said
But you don't even know you don't even know


And I could kill for your songs
And I won't let any of us go on




I love my guitar
It is my friend
It's there when I am sad
It's there when I am mad
It's there when I'm too lonely at night
yes...
That's right
.
My friends all like me because I play guitar
Now I have a girlfriend because of my amazing guitar skills
As long as me n guitar are together we'll go so far, beyond the hills
Yeah.. Thanks dude.
My guitar
Yes... Thank you.
bah




I woke up on christmas day and found nothing
i even made cookies and milk and you still gave me nothing
Santa you fat piece of shit you have nothing to say
i even wanted to write a letter to you in the 2nd grade
I woke up and found my stocking full of coal
Naughty list or not thats pretty cold

i stabbed them a lot 
i stabbed them a lot
i stabbed them


Night falls on the kingdom of Aragu, and King Emon Herbet settles down for a peaceful night’s sleep. Little does he know that this night will bring anything but peace...




Would you like a bedtime story tonight, your highness?
Hmm...yes. How about, “The tale of two Crabs”
An excellent choice, your majesty. *ahem* Once upon a time, deep under the sea, there lived two crabs who were madly - 
Stop.
A different story perhaps, your highness?
No, listen. What is that noise…?
King Herbet, terrible news! Your brother, the evil Trawberry, has returned!
Oh no...




Brother of mine, your time has come
I’ve returned to reclaim my throne
Can’t say I took kindly to my banishment
But I’ve had plenty of time to plot my revenge


If only father could see this war
If only mother hadn’t loved you more
Brother of mine, please don’t repine
I’m just taking back my birthright 


The outer defenses have fallen!
Reinforce the inner strongholds! Do not let him through!
Sir, his forces are too many! 
The castle is lost!


I’ll be storming your castle walls
As powerless you watch them fall
Looks like I’ll be taking this city
Thanks for keeping it so pretty for may


Of your kingdom I’ll be taking the whole thing
I hope your citizens get used to the new king
Brother of mine, ain’t nothing so sweet
As savouring your defeat, oh!


Sire, we must get you to safety!
But, my men, they…!
The city is taken, your majesty! You’re no use to the kingdom dead!
...you’re right. Quick, we must go to the secret passage. 
At once. Get the king to safety! 


Your soldiers are dead, the doors open wide
Castle walls crushed along with your pride
Brother of mine, my brother so fine
I’d say this ain’t personal, but that’d be a lie


It’s the end of your age, the end of your time
Hope you enjoyed your spot in the light of the lime
And should you return, then you will find
Your kingdom belongs to ME, oh Brother of Mine!




Your majesty, we’ve reached the other end of the secret passage. 
Quick, someone fetch me my royal messenger, Turnek.
Hoo hoo! You called for me, sire?
Turnek, I must rely on you now in our time of need. You must deliver a message to my son, Ime.
Of course! What is the message?
You must tell him that the city has fallen, and then his Uncle Trawberry has returned. However, before he can return, he must claim the tri-colored jewel from the top of Mount Erego. More than just being the right of the Herbet family to rule, it imbues those of the Herbet lineage with a great power. With this, he may be able to defeat Trawberry, and save the kingdom. Now go, time is of the essence!
I shall do as you say, sire.




Turnek flies off to find Prince Ime as fast as his old owl wings will allow. He finds the prince less than a day’s journey away from mount Erego. 




Hoo, hoo! Prince Ime!
Turnek! What brings you here? News from my father?
Terrible news, I’m afraid! You uncle Trawberry has returned, and the kingdom has fallen!
Then we must head back at once!
No, not so fast prince. Your father told me more: before you return, you must reclaim the tri-colored jewel from the top of Mount Erego. It will give you incredible strength, which you can use to defeat your evil uncle. But you must be quick, time is of the essence!
Woah, awesome! Let’s go then, we haven’t a second to waste!




We’re on our way to save the kingdom
We can’t be stopped, we can’t be slowed down
Return the land to a state of freedom,
On our mission to reclaim the crown!


Not so fast, prince Ime so little
First you have got to solve my riddle 
Before I can allow you to proceed
Well, that sounds easy enough to me!


What is a creature that lives off the ground,
Can turn its head all the way round,
It likes to work while others sleep,
And mice are what it likes best to eat.


Oh, of course the answer is - 
No, wait! I need to do this on my own.
Why?
 
Hmm, this one’s real tough…
Sire, I’m right here, I -
Eats mice? Awake at night?
Sire, the answer is literally me!
A real head scratcher…
Oh my...it’s a -
I’ve got it! It’s an owl!
Correct!


We’re on our way to great adventure
Gonna get that tri-colored stone
No slowing down, only moving faster
Travel up the mount of Erego!


Not so fast prince, if you’re wanting to proceed
You’ll first have to find for this door a key
Which stands at the top of this redwood tree
Well up I go, this’ll be easy for me!


Sire, I could always fly you up…
No, Turnek, this is my quest! Sit back and watch!


Sire please, do be careful
Watch out for that branch!
Oh no, oh dear, I can’t look!
(falling sound)
I got it!
Oh, my…


We’re on our way, and I’m feeling unstoppable!
To save the people of Aragu
There is no challenge I can’t topple
There is nothing that I can’t do! 


Oh but prince, if you want to go further
You’re going to have to cross this here river!
Hah! I could do that on a whim!
Sire, may I remind you that YOU CAN’T SWIM!


Please, sire, let me carry you across. Like your father said: “Time is of the essence!”
Oh please, Turnek. I can just jump across this! Besides, I don’t know what that means. Here I go!


Let me get a running start…
I’m too old for this...
Watch me go!
Just like his father was at that age…
Hyup! Made it, alright!
Allright…


Cmon, Turnek! The fun’s just getting started!
This is never going to end...




The hopeful Prince Ime sets off to scale the looming peak of Mount Erego, and claim the tri-colored jewel of the Herbet line. Will our heroes be able to save the kingdom in time? Or will Aragu fall under the evil Trawberry’s rule forever? Find out next time on Ime the Prince!


Visitor and villager
Don't you mind this stolen style
Your voice is in the background of my visions
Company symbol I see
Haven't seen you in a while
But how proud of me you'll be when you listen


They stole from me a stellar key
To the deep recess beneath
Every possibility of speech forgotten
Like naval metal ironclads
On a white and bloody, wet warpath
The sea life becomes dead weight and starts it's rotting


When my parents die I hope some things die with them
Like the rent free space that their old parents live in
Where they'd plant the fear of god and all things forbidden
May it leak into the soil and be rewritten


A few thousand towering great oak trees
Wear prehistoric eyes
Take a heavy sigh in their failure to instruct us
It speaks to me in history
Like when 3 million innocent people died
Under the guise of sacrifice and justice


When the rapturous new wave melts my eyes
Along with those I've known my whole life
May they burst and join the sludge that is my family
A horrific bodily genocide
That can't hope to be romanticized
There's nothing I can say to ease the gravity


When my friends all die I hope some things die with them
Like the weight of death before they calm their inhibitions
Bring them back to life with time machines and ribbons
May whatever higher power deem them forgiven


And in the future when I'm newer
And you're letting go my heart
Out to pasture like a dancer
Who knows nothing of the art
Let it change or wade or fade
Or anything it has to do
Think of it like a cosmic ugly duckling
Coming out the womb


When I die I hope that several things die with me
Like the mental byproducts that pose as litany
Or maybe the make history and outlive me
And I'll go on for as long as they'll permit me


Never gonna forget
Never gonna remember
What I’ve said
I’ve said too much


I don’t make that much
I don’t build enough
The bottle rocket
And tape it up


I’ve cleaned my room
I clean my things
I clean it too
Doo doo doo


I said Scooby Doo
I don’t know what to do with you
I go clean my room
Again and again


This song’s gonna end


Buy another box
Buy another box
And box it up
I don’t need it anymore


And tape it shut


I tape it shut
I need another box
I need another box
I need another box
To box it all up


Don’t you ever forget
But I never remember
What I said
I need it


Grunt, grunt, mmph
Ha! We made it to the top of Mount Erego! 
Look, Prince Ime! It is the tri-colored jewel! (bling!)
Huh, it’s...smaller than I thought it’d be. 
Well, pick it up sire! 
Right! (Fwish!)
Do you feel any...stronger?
Stronger? I didn’t know what strong WAS until now! Taking the kingdom back is going to be even easier than I thought!
Then quick, prince, we must return to Aragu as quickly as possible! I can fly you there, if -
Fly? I feel as if I could make it there in a single leap! Just try and keep up, Turnek! Ya-hoo!
P-prince! Wait for me!




The tri-colored jewel has been obtained by the young Prince Ime, and with new strength he runs faster than ever before to the Kingdom of Aragu.




Mmm hmm hmm hmm, hope you enjoyed your spot in the light of the -
Brawk! King Trawberry, your highness!
Ooh, that DOES have a nice ring to it! What news have ya got, Crumbwell the Crow?
Your highness, that impudent Ime has been captured! He was found trying to single handedly storm your castle. 
Well, bring him in! 
Uncle Trawberry!
Nephew Ime.
I’m here to take back the castle, and the kingdom!
Brawk! Not in those bindings, you won’t!
You’re right. Uncuff ‘em, boys!
Y-your highness!
Trust me, he could’ve broken those at any time. He has the strength to do so, now that he has...the tri colored jewel.
Gasp! How did you know?
Heh heh heh! Oh my naive nephew, I may not have had the best grades, but I did pay attention in Herbet Family History class. There’s a jewel on the top of Mount Erego for every son in the Herbet family, and before I returned to capture the kingdom, I got mine as well! (bling!) 
This...that doesn’t matter! I’ll still defeat you, and take back MY kingdom!
We’ll see about that, nephew! 


This will be your end, uncle!
Your cute threats just make me chuckle.
I’ll avenge my father, and my people, too!
I’d like to see THAT come true.
And I’ll wipe that stupid grin off your face!
Let’s see you win this battle in the first place.
(Either way,) I won’t resign
(Till) (cuz) this throne’s mine!


Oh little Ime, you really are a great fool
If you truly thought that you could contest MY rule!
It would’ve been better for you to just skip town
Don’t you know you’ll never be worthy of the crown!


It’s obvious you’re a little slow
But try to get it through ya skull
My right to rule is divine
And this throne’s mine!


Your evil deeds end here today
Those you’ve wronged you will repay
I will avenge my father’s crown
Right here and now, I’ll take you down!


There’s no one that I can’t defeat
By my hand, you’ll soon be beat
There’s no plan I can’t realize
This throne’s mine!


Oh don’t tell me you’re getting tired?
This battle is getting down to the wire!
What’s the matter boy, something wrong?
I can’t win... he’s just too strong!
Heh heh heh... what a pity!
No, I’ve got to save the city!
You’re the last one I’ll have to remind,
This throne’s MINE!!
Nooooooooo!!!




Just like your father. You think you can do everything by yourself. Well, ya can’t! Too late for you to learn the lesson now, boy.
Brawk! Do you want us to finish him off, King Trawberry?
Hmm...no. Throw this brat in the river. I heard he can’t swim!  
Splash! 




I didn’t know the secret passage led to your vacation house on the river.
Yes, I would come here sometimes when the stresses of being the king were too much.
Hoo hoo! Your highness!
Turnek! You’ve returned. But where’s Ime?
He went to challenge your brother, Trawberry. But I was forced to flee before the battle reached its conclusion. I fear the worst…
Look! Something’s in the river!
It’s a body!
Quick pull them out!
Gasp It’s the prince!
Ime! My son! Is he alright?
He’s still alive, your majesty. Though barely…
Quick, place the tri colored jewel on his forehead. (bling)
Cough, cough… Father?
Oh, Ime, you’re alright!
No, father. I’ve let you down! I wasn’t able to defeat Trawberry, and now he has complete control over the kingdom! Oh, this is all my fault, I thought I could do everything on my own, but it turns out I can’t do anything…
No, my son. I expected too much from you. This...is my fault.




In my attempt to raise you up in the best way that I could, it seems
That I neglected the most important lesson for a King
I filled you up with confidence, I told you that “You can do anything,”
And in this failure as a parent, I hope you shall soon forgive me


For it isn’t true that anyone can do everything alone
Not even a king, who sits above everyone on top his throne
In times of hardships, in times of doubt, simply look around you
And ask for help for the people you trust, from those that surround you


For it’s true that while we cannot do everything on our own,
There is no limit to what WE can achieve! Now, let us go!
My brother’s getting far too comfortable in MY castle where he stays
So there isn’t a single moment to waste, we’ve got a kingdom to save!




Ime and his father, Emon, storm the castle with renewed strength. They go, not to fight Trawberry alone, but together.




Brawk! Who goes there?
Out of my way, Crumbwell.
King Trawberry! Ime has returned...with your brother!!
What?!
Trawberry! Your royal decorator has horrible taste, I can see.
You know for a FACT that I put up those decorations myself. So, my cowardly brother, and my nephew who’s back from the dead. Have ya come to beg for mercy?
In your dreams, uncle! Now, I’m - no, WE’RE back to reclaim OUR kingdom!
FINE! I’ll just defeat you BOTH, and I’ll finish the job this time! 
We’ll see about that! 


You’ve come so far to end up where you are, right beside me
The journey was hard, right from the start something I didn’t foresee
But now I look and see not just a prince, but my son, the King
Now I begin to feel that there really is nothing that we can’t achieve!


We can do anything!
We can do anything!


No...how can the two of you be so much stronger than I am?? I am a son of Herbet, I HAVE THE TRI COLORED JEWEL!!
Trawberry, none of us could rule this kingdom on our own. You are no exception. Now, this is your end!


We can do anything! (No limit to what we can achieve!)
We can do anything! 


Ime the Prince, with the help of his father King Emon Herbet, defeated the evil Trawberry and restored peace to the kingdom of Aragu. With his recovery of the tri-colored jewel, and his defeat of a tyrant, Ime was soon crowned King of Aragu, ushering in a long period of prosperity for all the citizens of the land. Thus concludes the tale of Emon, Trawberry, and Ime the King.




Black, black and burned away
Sharp, sharp and charred remains
“So beautiful” I say
This is where we used to stay


Cold, cold these memories
Stop, stop the rising heat
This pointless bickering
Did it cost us everything? 


Hands and faces, pointed towards the sky
Sometimes you move so slow, sometime you fly
Hands and faces, watch it all run dry
Couldn’t end too soon, couldn’t ask why


Dead, dead and moved on
Broke, broken is your bond
Can’t see that you’re gone
Empty table, empty lawn


Fight, fight for your pride
Kill, kill for your time
With the passing of each night
Lose the hope you had inside


Hands and faces, pointed towards the sky
Sometimes you move so slow, sometime you fly
Hands and faces, watch it all run dry
Couldn’t end too soon, couldn’t ask why


Hands and faces, pointed towards the sky
What a silly thing for all of us to die
Hands and faces, strewn across the ground
When you turn the world all the way ‘round


The first thing I wanted to be was king of the world
But I’d probably have to kill for that
And I don’t want blood on my hands
It’s hard enough killing every bug in sight
Can you imagine a man go splat?
No I don’t wanna deal with that


I barely have control over myself
So I’m gonna have to put that one on the shelf


The next thing I wanted to do was make video games
But writing code makes me insane
And my attention would just wane
I’d be working at the same damn line
And my brain just can’t react
No I don’t wanna deal with that


If then statements look like Egyptian glyphs
A life in an office wondering what if


It won’t get better than it was before I know
Without a little help from me
And everyone I need
And an academic degree


Stuck fishing for the keys in my pocket
I had a grip before but now that I’ve lost it
Who’s up for some timeline hopping?
Barricade, don’t let the cops in


I’m sitting pretty inside everyone else’s
Minds but no dead ends just isn’t really helping
Let me sign off on our Celtic
Land grant with a purple felt tip


And I don’t care if nobody is there
You’re not just anyone what wonder wasn’t
Walking when we joined the sunset?


It won’t get better than it was before I know
Without a little help from me
Everyone I need
An academic degree


first thing i wanted to 
be was burning alive 
light me up to brighten up 
everyone inside


its a bit of bother 
its a bit of a pain
but the sunburned skin
keeps me entertained


im feeling hot im feeling heavy
the time of my life 
passed me by and i wasn't ready




The dead of night, the sound of many feet
A terrible sight, a fate you don’t want to meet


Upon your home they will descend
As you pay for their sins


Black on black, on black on red
Don’t make a sound, or you’ll be dead


Pray to your God, they’ll pray to theirs
As judgement falls with your despair 


Nothing to lose, what’s yours to gain
You’ve been visited by The Runaway Gang


This violence, is nothing new
Different people, the same rules


Without a country, without hope
A makeshift family, a hobbled home


Expect no mercy, make no mistake
They’ll burn your insides, your skin and face


Nothing to lose, the world to gain
You’ve been visited by The Runaway Gang




I'm in a twisted loop
I made a wrong turn
And I'm never leaving my lunar tomb
I live with head cases and freaks
They all think and speak like me
I think there's something wrong with me
What's wrong with me?


I'm in the worst timeline
I sleep in cave huts
And I kill myself hoping the stars align
I sold my soul to the dogs for free
Chasing the happy family dream
Hoping it would come back to me
Come back to me


Queen of the sea, take a swing at me
I need an evil to defeat
I need to know
Please let me go


I play a cursed game
I never had friends
Who would take the time to even try to play
I got a job on a whale shaped ship
Looking for some new relationships
And no one even knows my name
Who knows my name?


I'm made of code and cords
Locked in a steel shell
And I'll get up every time I hit the floor
I'm losing sleep from the curse of caves
And I just can't stay away
Some day I'm gonna beat this game
I'll beat this game


Two headed freak, take a swing at me
I need a reason to believe
I need to know
Please let me go


My old life won't come back
Like the cat that I sac'd
Except that thing still comes back


Cosmic beast set your eyes on me
I need a means to leave this place
I need to know
Please let me go


So a little birdie whispers in my ear
That there's something weird coming near
Oh no it's summer and there's nothing to do
Because the sky is blue and I'm feeling it too




Oh no it's summer when the gang's all here
They got my back covered and my schedule is clear




Oh no






So the little birdie comes back




Oh no




A proposition dressed in black






Oh no




He's got an event for all of us






We're on the road down to Schlitterbahn


Hope the drive doesn't take too long
We'll get burned, we'll get wet
And we're better for it




We're on the road down to Schlitterbahn


All your fears will be gone
Hold your breath, don't you sink


That would suck, I would think






Oh hey it's summer and there's something to do


I got my friends with me and I also got you


Oh hey it's summer and the day's getting hot
The song's getting louder but my voice will get shot!




Who cares?




Uh... guys?






Who cares?






Who's gonna feed my cat?




Who cares?






Guys seriously uh... who's gonna feed my cat?




We're on the road down to Schlitterbahn


Hope the drive doesn't take too long
We'll get burned, we'll get wet


And we're better


(This is the part of the song where we crash the car)


For it




Another pause in this conversation
If that happens again, I think I might die
I can’t help from thinking that this time is wasted
And about how later I’ll probably cry


And happiness now comes inside a drink
To make all your troubles sunny and shining
It’d be easier if I didn’t have to think
About whether or not you actually like me


But there’s still a part of me needing to wonder
And I can’t go on never knowing at all
If this whole thing is about to go under
I have to stand before I can fall


I wish that I didn’t care
Oh I wish I didn’t have to care at all


There’s Vuhor for the home, Vatus for wishing,
And Verkhiv’ya reigns as the goddess of creation
But I think that there’s one of them missing
Where’s the god of awkward social situations? 


And I laugh at the jokes that don’t even amuse me
I cry in the car to some stupid song
I stare at the ceiling for hours and think
Over and over about what I did wrong


So I smile now, the camera is rolling
And I wish for the drink that tastes like the sun
Because my mind is mess and my heart is moaning
How could you think that this was fun?


And the more that I’m sure you don’t understand me
The more I don’t care that I don’t know you
And you tell me you can’t tell when I am hurting
So if I can fool you, I’ll keep acting the fool


I wish that I didn’t care
I wish that I didn’t care
I wish that I didn’t care
Oh I wish I didn’t have to care at all


You're dead to me
But in a good way
You're long gone now
But I want you to stay
And eye for an eye for the lovely alive
But we see through em like sheets of white


No pentagrams
Or spinning heads
Just hand in a hand
Infused with the dead
At the crack of dusk there's a creak and rust
And a creeping feel in the AC's gust


I see through you
You'll see it through


I love you man
I'll hold you close
Cuz you support me
When I punch ghosts
And should those 'geists take flight in spades
We'll hunt them down come next Sunday


And naturally
They'll take up arms
It's funny cuz
They don't have arms
But while we're here they'll do no harm
We'll send em back to their graveyard


I see through you
You'll see it through
You know there ain't nobody out there like us two
I don't need some kinda miracle
I believe in the immaterial


Digging holes that are meant to bury
Our souls escaping from
Your nose and bless the space
Between where we can't touch much
From the unseen where you and I
Will draw lines that match how we
Feel inside in order to see you
In order to see you
In order to see you
In order to see you


Take a chance hold out your hands and give me a high five
I'm picking rock or maybe not I really can't decide


Take a chance hold out your hands and give me a high five
I'm picking rock or maybe not I really can't decide
This spice of life is just too much for me sometimes
Which is what I'd like to say but I always get snake eyes


Digging holes ini my walls trying to punch
Ghosts and I miss with  my fists
I don't know if they really exist


And honestly I don't really care
As long as I pretend that they're there
They can keep my mind off my white hairs
Or all of that time spent in one chair


Take a chance hold out your hands and give me a high five
I'm picking rock or maybe not I really can't decide


Take a chance hold out your hands and give me a high five
I'm picking rock or maybe not I really can't decide
I want to pray to make every day as good as the last
But that would mean I would be as bored as I was in the past
This spice of life is just too much for me sometimes
Which is what I'd like to say but I always get snake eyes


Whose eyes do I see staring back at me?
Whose face pale and cold is this someone I should know?
Dead eyes of pure white strangely beautiful in the night
Bringing me a cold delight the face they occupy is mine 


Teacher, teacher why so cold, so afraid of what you don’t know
But I have seen beyond the fold far beyond what I’ve told
They tell me not to be afraid but I’m excited, is that strange?
For the first time in my life the way I see the world has changed


They tell me of wonders I will find if I stay at their side
But now I’ve found a god in whom I can truly abide
I love every moment being chosen living with this so called demon
They call you false and evil, but I know that you’re my friend


I have a job now
I wake up on time
To a room of adults
Who look like they wanna die
But here I stand
Bright and wide eyed
C'mon guys!
If nothing else, I'm a sign


We'll be alright we'll be okay
How'd you sleep last night? What needs fixing today?
Wanna hear a joke? All work no pay
C'mon guys! We'll be okay


I have a life now?
I have coworkers
I've got responsibilities
And frankly, that's absurd
And something's off
This room's warmer
And we still have time to talk about how American households are powered by transformers
And the building's breaking down like it was never built
Right deadlines closing in on left and right
Equipment hot enough to cook my food
When's lunch time? Tell me all about your news
Wires long enough to wrap up the whole staff
Where'd my boss go? Why we always low on gaff?


We'll be alright we'll be okay
This building's like a concrete maze
If this company sends us to our graves
We'll be alright we'll be okay
We'll be okay




I wake up in the morning 
There is nothing for me
I don’t like this at all


People tell me what to do 
They talk to me like I’m a fool
I don’t know where to go from here


I don’t know where I belong
I’ve been stuck here way to long
I just want to know what I can be


My problems have gone unaddressed
I can’t handle all this stress
I just need to take sec and breathe


I’m not gonna be depressed
I will go out and find success
My head is clear, I finally believe


The roads I walk are way too long 
I can’t condense my thoughts to this song 
Nuh nah nah nah nah nah


It’s probably just in my head
I’m living life like I’m dead
I’m ready to change that all up


Lately I’ve been feelin’ better
I might get things back together
Maybe my life will be just fine


My problems might now be addressed
I can handle a little less stress
I can live and finally just breathe


I’m not gonna be depressed
I will go out and find success
My head is clear, I finally believe
I believe




I'm getting real tired of the same damn drives
And the same damn songs and the same damn lines
And you receive a piece of me
And sense of peace indeed
But this road hypnosis travels travels me through time
Another ten, twenty, hundred years will pass me by
Before


I can get out of my head
I can be happy in my bed
I can be happy in my head
I can get out of my bed


It's a bad habit of mine I repeat myself too much
It's a bad habit of mine I repeat myself too much
It's a bad habit of mine I repeat myself too much
I seem to waste all my time my clock is frozen to the touch


I find it kinda strange I prefer the last mile I drove
To the one I'm driving now except when you're driving me around
I feel at ease I feel at peace
These small pieces falling out I say "at least they hit the ground"


This road hypnosis fucks with me it's driving me insane
I'm so obsessed with going straight I'm too scared to change my lane
I get too stuck in my own head but my thoughts are all the same
I get too stuck in my own head but my thoughts are all the same


It's a bad habit of mine I repeat myself too much
It's a bad habit of mine I repeat myself too much
It's a bad habit of mine I repeat myself too much
I seem to waste all my time my clock is frozen to the touch


Yeah
Timmy Jimmy on the mic
I don't want to start a fight
But I, uh, just might have to
Back to
Who knew?
UH
Got Alessio on the guitar
Y'know he's gonna take us far
I wouldn't exactly call these "bars"
More like
Bricks
Get hit
All these chicks
I'm talking to are bricks
SIKE
I LIED
I ain't talking to chicks
That's ick-y
Unlike my boy, CFH
He's slidin' in
To those DMs like
"Have you heard of Death Grips?
I know you're gonna like it"
Hamza out here causing trouble
But when's he gonna get that Bumble?
And Zach thinks he's a cutie
But I got him on that mutie
Cuz I don't wanna hear what he's gotta say to me
A tree
In the backyard
And the fruits are
Jealousy
That's what Zach feels cuz everybody else
Is unmuted
(Except Hamza sometimes)
Schmang Ween
Mmm
Yeah
Break it down, Alessio


I just want to eat a sandwich 
(Mmmm, sandwich)
But all the sandwiches were damaged
(Oh my god) 
Don’t know how I’ll ever manage 
(How can I eat)
When everything is such a mess
(My lunch like this)


The veggies
(Deli meats)
The sauces 
(Cheddar cheese)
Are all over the place
(The bread fell apart)


I’ll just take it
(Add to a bowl)
And make it
(Mix it all up)
A salad instead
(Do not lose heart)




Waterfalls and Sunny days
It should always be this way
Good weather got me feelin’ great
Put me in the mood you can’t hate
Because happy, and I feel good
Waking up smelling that pine wood


I see the mountains climbing over tree tops
They go for miles and miles do they ever stop
Beauty is a subjective thing 
But there are some things we can agree
Like when the sun shines on the grass dew drops
My brain lights up and my smile pops 


And if I was born today
I would enjoy life the same ol way
Because this world is so beautiful
You like to rag on it but it’s not that dull at all


Have you ever been on the sands
Water rushing towards you while you get a tan
The waves coming in peaking real high 
The make you feel good and you’re thoughts fly
Wind is coming to you at mach 9
Being here is such a special time


If I was born today 
My life could come out in such a better way
That’s okay it’s really alright
The only thing I care for is the current fight
That’s why I’ve got to enjoy this one I have




Wouldn’t it be great if we said “I like you”
To one another just a little more often?
And I wouldn’t mind if you cried a few tears
As the sad song plays and they lower my coffin


When I open the door at 4am 
I hope that I won’t wake you again
Im sorry when I can’t be myself 
It’s only cuz I’m trying to figure out who I am


I’m sorry that you have to wear earplugs when I’m around
Cuz I always yell so loud and


I’m sorry that you don’t always get the best of me
But the rest of me you seem to like as well


Wouldn’t it be great if we said “I like you”
To one another just a little more often?
And I wouldn’t mind if you cried a few tears
As the sad song plays and they lower my coffin


When the sound of the road overwhelms us both
We’ll sing all the louder to the tune of the Ghost
And if Phil lights the way out into the night
I know I’ll be wanting you there by my side


And I don’t always know what to say or to do or to be around you
But you’ve shown me that’s OK 
And I don’t care what you say or do or are 
As long as you stay you around me




KT 1000 I've fallen behind 
can't tell the difference in the turning of the sun
all my convictions burn away except for one...


there's not much more to say
the words will float away
but failure will follow me 
until I've fallen in my grave


and yet
the bottom of the creek had got 
me slippin
I was trippin and then fallin for you....


Well I could be so different
Like any other idiot
Who tried to make a dent in the world
How I would sit and wonder here
How every couple hundred years
And idol would suddenly emerge


And I look over to you
And it's 6:32
Well now that can't be true
Cuz it was 6:00 just 30 minutes ago


But I'm bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Roll your dice and I'll roll mine
We'll see who makes it out alive


Will this effect the economy?
Make some kind of homogeny?
Do I even know what this all means?
If it isn't quite so obvious
Your neighbor is a communist
Your favorite brand is just a machine


So play to us with pots and pans
Line them all with cotton pads
You really wanna practice that preach
Find some sort of synonym
Words for what I'm living in
If it's your blood then call me your leech


But it's 6:42
And well what can you do?
You've been checking since noon
You've never gotten younger, y'know


And you're bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Hope you've got a comfy chair
When you end up buried in your hair


Oh I'll try to be there
Every hundred years out of spite
But as it stands I can't move a hair
It don't sit right
It don't sit right


Cuz we're bound and gagged by the legend of the dragon
Can't keep tabs on my schedule will just drag on
Well have fun trying to fit this in the canon
Feel your eyes at half open
Might as well be closed by then


I look over again
And the song's boutta end
And I'm bashing my head
I swear it started just two minutes ago








I’m walking down the street
Being all edgy
Feelings
Being all over the hedgy


Meaning is lost on this soul
Because meaning is just how I roll


It takes some time to make any cents
But by then I’ve used the wrong one


Sharpen your sword and eat the poultry bags
Come patriot, to be a compatriot 


Its takes some time to make a repents
But by then I’ve viewed the song done






Here I am sitting in my room
Around me 4 walls of doom
Sun up high it’s noon
And I’m sitting around like baboon


Staring at my computer 
Writing songs and what for
I got a dresser over there
It’s right across from my desk chair


I see My duffel bag on the floor
Right next to my bathroom door
Got the router right next to me 
And Chilling drinking green tea


Yeah I’m in my room
I bet that you are too
And you haven’t got a clue
That it means so much to you 


Shelves full of books that I’ve never read,
And they’ll probably sit there til I’m stone cold dead
Sometimes I feel existential dread 
But it’s alright I’ll go on ahead 


Hat Rack on the northern wall
Go out my door and enter the hall
Go into my closet if I need a ball
Give me a second I’m getting a call
“Sorry I can’t “
“Cuz I’m in my room”
“yeah”
Yeah I’m in my room
Where thoughts boil and brew
Feel escape from any gloom
Go on pause til I resume


It’s nice to kick back
Give life some slack
Take the load off
Lay on something soft
It feels so nice
When you don’t think twice
And remember what it’s like to enjoy the moment


Yeah I’m in my room
That’s right I’m in my room
I’ll never leave my room
Until I have to leave my room






The walls
Keep an eye on me
It crawls
Deep inside of me
You wanna blow it up before it eats us
This monstrous place that desecrates us


But I
Don't realize
The time
When clocks begin to fly
With the wings it grew
Sorry angel please let us through


I'm sick of being in this house that breathes
And the fungal spores that shoot out of me
The flies keep piling to the sky
With no end in sight
The sink stinks the fridge is full of rot
It's easy to think that this is all I've got


I'm sick of being in this house that breathes
And the fungal spores that shoot out of me
The flies keep piling to the sky
With no end in sight




Too early in my lifetime
The second sun now comes to rise


I was brash and eager then
Chasing down our villain's men
I could've sworn their tails were 'tween their legs
Could I have grown a bigger, thicker head?


That noble rage disappearing
The spit I spoke was endearing
But skin like this is too good for the noose
In failure you still have a job to do


Oh I feel aspirations flailing off
With every hand that does me wrong
I thought I'd age but now I'm not
Under the victor's lock
I've lost all me
Can you tell I'm free?


Taken as the army knelt
Close beside the buyer's belt


Am I prepared to admit defeat?
Be rid of all my dignity?
I've never known disgust like this before
The safest haven close by is the floor


Think of me equal though I'm weak
Entertain me as I speak
Oh I plead guilty to my bitter past
Would you loosen the lead if I just asked?


Lovely you ignore your chains
Free of time for all your days
What use is that planning anymore?


Lovely you I've brought a gift
The happy feeling of a fist
And one day, you will float back to our shore


Lovely you ignore your chains
Free of time for all your days
Lovely you ignore your chains
Free of time for all your days


Life seems to continue on
And everything I was is gone
No thought of all the loved ones that miss me
No I'm too busy hunched over my feet


The rescue team is whistling
Please settle for my siblings
Their brother died in some freak accident
Too inordinary to make a dent


So feel the steel so silvery
Resist no more now sing with me
Thin and rid of ugly dignity


The lessons learned are never right 
I only learn from losing fights
The only person worth a damn is me 


I cast deception upon you 
The guys around don’t have a clue
It’s not what I like it’s what I do


But maybe I can learn a thing
Maybe I can fix my wrongs
I said maybe there’s something here for me after all
 
Here the small things always hurt
The problems presented here are the worst
Nothing can help me now 
My pains towered up can’t get down


I’m all the way here 
My life is way down there
All I wanna do
Is go back to it


I waiting it out
I’m trying so hard
Time has to pass
But hurry up


I sent away my sins
I’m trying to save my skin
Bad things just keep crawling on back to me
I don’t know where to escape these things


I don’t know where to go
I can’t get my life flow
Nothing works 
Anxiety lurks 
 
And  here the small things always hurt
The problems presented here are the worst
Nothing can help me now 
My pains towered up and I can’t get down


I’m all the way up here 
My life is way down there
All I wanna do
Is go back to it




drifting away 
on these cloudy saturdays 
i am stuck
in some sort of haze 
that’s why i stay 
confined to my cave 
i’m scared to blow away


youve never had an idea in your life
watch every chess match start with e5
i wanna be able to blow everyone away
with a move that lelouch couldnt think of today


cuz i lack forsight this board might flip
angel on my shoulder to record my int
rook and bishop the queen and king
and people and various other things


its the same as you
what ive been through
when i think it over
and over again
and ill be dead
in five years time
hey thats my line
hey thats my line


drifting away 
on these cloudy saturdays 
i am stuck
in some sort of haze 
that’s why i stay 
confined to my cave 
i’m scared to blow away




There were once two bros so friendly
The whole world looked on them with envy
But they had one problem over which they’d divide:


Both of them had way too much pride






And one fateful day they got into a fight


About something in which neither of them were right


And instead of talking like civilized men
They decided never to speak again




Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say OH


Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say to me everyday






And people looked on at them and thought
“Gee, I kinda like that idea a lot”
“In this cruel world it’s too hard to be heard,”


“So let’s just quit solving our problems with words.”






And pretty soon the entire population
Decided to cease any and all communication


And begin their indefinite isolation
They wanted no more of this “socialization”






Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say OH


Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say to me everyday




And when the last two people on the planet decided
They’d rather have their relationship divided
That’s when the gods chose to intervene
And sent down old faithful Frankline


Who found those two idiots who began
This whole business of not speaking to your fellow man
And when Frankline arrived he held out his hand


And turned the both of them into sand




And he spread their remains far and wide


As a reminder to those with too much pride


Of what could happen to the entire world


If people chose not to say a word




Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!
I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say OH


Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say to me everyday




But if I look back at what happened, I find


If we all just shut up, that I wouldn’t mind
The worst that can happen from what I understand


Is that maybe a few of us get turned into sand?






Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say OH


Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!


I don’t wanna hear you or the stupid things you say to me everyday




No seriously, shut UP. hehe, that doesn't even sound like a word anymore.




You promised me maids
You promised life on repeat


You promised grenades
I wanted a lifetime supply of your voice
Wouldn't that be a treat?


Headache headache head to bed at late night
Blanking blanking under flanking bright lights
Mother father don't know how to speak right
Verkhiv'ya sleeps under a chocking deadline
Pretty pretty with bad eyes


You promised me pay
You promised a title that functioned at launch


You promised no slaves
You promised distraction distraction at lunch




I love you and you’re so sweet
You’re nice and you love me
You are the most important thing
In my life
Oh and here we go
The sun has come to show
I got to put in the energy 
To fly above my deficiencies


I don’t know and you don’t know 
What is coming tomorrow
Plans are just an outline
We don’t have to follow
I don’t know and you don’t know 
What is coming tomorrow
So let’s just go on
And do it today


Oh it doesn’t have to be that way
We know what to do just no mistakes
Maybe it is just the things I say
But I’m telling you today’s the day 
For us


I don’t know and you don’t know 
What is coming tomorrow
Plans are just an outline
We don’t have to follow
I don’t know and you don’t know 
What is coming tomorrow
So let’s just go on
And do it today


And I


Need a burger


So I am satisfied 


 if I didn't eat I would die




And fries


And a milkshake 


ketchup on the side


 now I'm satisfied






UGH




Yer so ugly eat a flipping big Mac


Watashi hungry munching on ur nutsack


Feeling rather funky like funky monkey


Leave me burnt up after stealing all my money




Eat through you like bleu cheese too


We ate too much but I might eat you


And if we feel full then don't mind us


I just gimme a bite I don't need much




And I


Need a burger


So I am satisfied 


 if I didn't eat I would die




And fries


And a milkshake 


ketchup on the side


 now I'm satisfied


Well I was goin’ on a walk just the other day
Down by the banks of the ole Gimblewaid 
When I saw an old man, just sittin’ in the sun
And he showed me his teeth, (of which he had none)
And I said, “sir, I am most impelled to ask why
Your teeth seem to have left your mouth unoccupied”
And turned to me then, with that toothless grin,
And he opened his mouth and said:


The river is blue for a reason
The river is blue for a reason


I went out fishin’ on the boat with my dad
And I asked him bout somethin’ that was making me sad
I said, “Why do the girls never turn my way,
I swear momma said they’d be all over me someday.”
And my dad took a long pause after that query,
And he looked me over with his eyes a bit dreary,
And as his cigar smoke blew away in the wind,
He said to me again


The river is blue for a reason
The river is blue for a reason, a season, there’s meanin’ but I don’t know what it is


And it was in that moment that I realized 
Grown ups had been lying to me my whole life




Another dream
That leaves me
Longing for my sister in the sea


A mother screamed
On the evening
A body washed up on our shore


Oh my
Don't run away from me
No more


My child
Can't even place your own two feet
On the floor


I tried to see
If I could relieve
A grieving woman's love for her absentee


A melody
So eerie


Oh my
Don't lie to anyone
No more


Wide eyed
How do you cover up the grime
On your soul?


Lady Sten takes her daily lurk
From her engaging crazy day at work
I swear the lazy gent was recently engaged
And now he's signing away his fiancé
"But even this won't last," she thought
Because it ripples further on and on
And on a sunny day in May
May you find another heart to break


Lady Sten hangs sheets and socks
To try to drain her head of those ugly thoughts
But the damp won't go away
Oh it just won't go away today


And the thoughts come like a great brick wall
As far back as you can recall
How could I have missed it all?


It all my go away
Before you have the chance to grey


Are you losing your place?
So come get it!


Are you hoping that the thunder strikes
Right under where you sit?


Well this is it
And this is all there is
You're missing it
How she sings the imagery
With all you're giving me
And I feel alright
At least this time




Hello
Are you there?


Hello
Where are you?


Hello?


Here we are we’re again we’re down grassy path
One more day upon this without feeling gods wrath
I don’t how much longer I can keep this charade
The days are weighing on me I just don’t feel safe


But that’s just my thoughts it just what I think
What I really need is a love link
Maybe what I need is just a girl
To come flip around my upside down world


It’s what I need     it’s what I want 
Can somebody just come and give me shot


Give me a chance I just need one
Give me a chance come on and have some fun
Give me a chance just me and you
Give me a chance you only have a few
Give me a chance it won’t be that hard 
Give me a chance it’s a walk in the park


They say its hard being the smartest one
guess im hard as hell
they say to lock your kids in hot cars
this says a lot about our times well


This stain on my jeans that came from my father
he worked to death so why should I bother
im over 18 so why cant I drink
all my friends blood now do you think


half a cup full of half and half
ten thousand jokes not worth a laugh
but im here and clearly on fire breathing
stop drop and rolling on the floor believing
take your eyes take your hands take your car take your wife
take it all too far and they might take your life
like serial killers resisting arrest
switch on their hearts screaming "Ohm I Chest"


some of me suddenly goes away every day
but it seems theyve already took my brain
i dont know break a bone its really not my say
but to me it seems we already are insane


They say its hard being the smartest one
guess im hard as hell
they say to lock your kids in hot cars
this says a lot about our times well


This stain on my jeans that came from my father
he worked to death so why should I bother
im over 18 so why cant I drink
all my friends blood now do you think


The autumn breeze
Blows through the trees
Bringing to me your voice
With the buzzing of bees


I think of you everyday
Here in this magical place
Though I live alone
There’s no other place I’d rather call home


And when my work here is done
When all the thread has been spun
I’ll leave it all behind
As I journey into the night


I will fly to you
I will fly to you
Over the mountains
And under the moon


And if this world should end
Before we can meet
We’ll make a new one again
Just you and me


I will fly to you
I will fly to you
Over the mountains
And under the moon
I will fly to you
I will fly to you
Over the mountains
And under the moon


I've been losing dreams
I've been getting sleep
I am getting messages from distant future me
He tells me nothing good could come from carrying on with our ways
Love the ones that love you now cuz sooner or later they won't wanna be around


I've had a frenzy
Laughing like a freak
I can't even sleep when just a good friend shares the sheets
Oh how am I gonna fraternize the way they never wanted?
I can barely pretend all the love and lies in daily life that I've bonded


I'm just too naive
I've been on the streets
I wish I could leave this place without you noticing
It's waste of space or something great but nothing in between
I need a place to hide away so I can romanticize in cathartic peace


Someone give me superpowers
I could save us just like that
Please don't give me superpowers
I would tear the world in half


I've been losing sleep
I've been getting dreams
I am getting stronger but I've long since stopped fighting
Oh I'll never be happy and I've never been happier


Someone give me superpowers
I could save us just like that
Please don't give me superpowers
I would tear the world in half




Talk about a comeback but have you ever made one
I know you want the runback but you don’t want a rerun
You don’t have what it takes to get to the top
When you get the matchup I go get the mop
I hear great things but all I see a flop
Once I get going I don’t ever stop


I’m invincible 
I’m unbreakable 
I’m on top of the world
I’m victorious 
It is glorious
You can’t take me down
I’m incredible
Unforgettable
I’m the end of your world
I’m miraculous
You can’t compare to this 
I will take you down


I make up stories about your shit talking
But when I show up I send you all walking
You talk a big game and it’s such a shame 
I’ll keep it tame cause I don’t know your name
I don’t like your actions I don’t mean to flame
But your downfall will be my claim to fame


I’m invincible 
I’m unbreakable 
I’m on top of the world
I’m victorious 
It is glorious
You can’t take me down
I’m incredible
Unforgettable
I’m the end of your world
I’m miraculous
You can’t compare to this 
I will take you down
I play broken songs on rusted strings
It's not my fault I take too long showering
We spent all of our time
Chasing other people's lives
We took all of our trash
To the curb and never looked back


Hey that's pretty if you know what I mean
God took a city by storm but I'm wondering
If that's fitting for the man with no clothes
Or brains or money or things of his own
If I could ever wake him up
From the cold sleep of death
Statistically sound you will snore
Along with the rest


And you grow old and fade without a footnote to your name
Shaking the mold from your face, time to book it from my grave


I play broken songs on rusted strings
And I won't stop until I am king
It was the worst time of my life
I'd like to travel back and make it right
We broke all of our chains
Days in advance
But told all of our brains
That we never had the chance
We never had the chance


And you grow old and fade without a footnote to your name
Shaking the mold from my face, time to book it from my grave


I want nothing more than nothing less
But I guess nothing is all I get
Fishing for the next thing
Gets way harder with rusted strings
And we spent all of our time
Chasing other people's lives
We took all of our trash
To the curb and never looked back
To the curb and never looked back




Conspiracies on warranties and broken elevators
It's a shame and I'll complain but 
I'll still take the stairs to you


a couple things that I can't fix
and things that I'll leave for later
I could live a little better 
if I tried but I'll make do


something's missing
the essence has atrophied
echoing endlessly 
weaker every time that it returns


Yet I listen
still missing it's company
taking down notes
even though I know I will never learn


Is this what you expected
are you this nervous too
what are you thinking of, what do you think I think of you 
 
I'm sure there's nothing new
you haven't heard before
But if that's true and we both knew 
what am I worried for


something's missing
the essence has atrophied
echoing endlessly 
weaker every time that it returns


Yet I listen
still missing it's company
taking down notes
even though I know I will never learn


If you'll listen,
I'm missing your company
will you remember me
after the day I don't return


It makes no difference
but if you find it comforting
take down my notes and let them burn


the things that I've already learned




Welcome...


...to beautiful Spookytown lodging. Are you tired of crowded kingdoms and bustling cities? Is there too much noise coming through your window at night?


The quiet, peaceful forests surrounding Spookytown cover miles and miles of rich, untouched vistas. A perfect getaway in complete isolation.


The polite residents of the town are only a short hike away from the lodge. There, you'll find the most gracious hospitality you'll come to know.

While the atmosphere may still disconcert or even petrify, your first impressions couldn't be further from reality.


I believed in you
I believed in you
But there's nothing to believe in
As the evil creeps in
I don't know if I can go on


The misunderstood populace are more than ready to open its doors back up to the world, to enlighten humanity about its colorful and captivating folklore. You won't wanna miss this history lesson.


So take that much needed vacation. Your life isn't going anywhere, but you are. Spookytown lodging. Wish you were here.






I guess i was late
i couldnt make it today
thought id write this down
with one foot in the grave


and it took two of me
or maybe it was three
to make one of you
eat all of our meet


but something stinks and we dont think all that much of it
i felt alive but now the flies gather round


and say something is dead and we don't mind
someone is dead all of the time
biting off your head with the same old lines
I said we're living like were dead inside
oh we're living like were dead inside


eye to eye mouth to mouth
we breathe and then breathe out
we breathe and then breathe out
we breathe and then breathe out
we breathe and laugh out loud


but something stinks and we dont think all that much of it
i felt alive but now the flies gather round


and say something is dead and we don't mind
someone is dead all of the time
biting off your head with the same old lines
I said we're living like were dead inside
oh we're living like were dead inside
oh we're living like were dead inside
oh we're living like were dead inside






When the orange leaves fall dead at your feet
When you start to have trouble falling asleep
It’s not just the cold that the autumn wind brings,
But also some more...unsavory things


On the edge of town, where nobody treads
On a moonless night that fills you with dread
In an alley forsaken by all living things
There can be heard a voice that sings


And should you look down that dreaded street
You’ll see a maiden white as a sheet
Beckoning you to come ever near
With her hand held out, her eyes full of tears


Don’t look into her eyes and fall under her spell,
Lest she swallow you whole and drag you to hell!
Young man, what you must remember the most
To save your life and soul: don’t follow the ghost!


Who gave this daughter of hell such power?
To hunger for all, and all to devour?
What deal with the demons did she agree,
And for such a deal, what was the fee?


And as I took her hand that night I didn’t realize
My own mistake as my body shriveled up and died!
And though I’ve passed I’ve realized there’s too much at stake
I’ve come back to guarantee you won’t make the same mistake!


Don’t look into her eyes and fall under her spell,
Lest she swallow you whole and drag you to hell!
Young man, what you must remember the most
To save your life and soul: don’t follow the ghost!




Day's
Orange hue
Keeps them blue
And it brews and it bruises
The walls of the stomach of mother don't fail
But calls of a murder keep crooked and frail


Night's
Come too soon
Step in my shoes
I see the moon by late noon
Oh when neighbors and good people fall fast asleep
Then comes labor and food that we scrounge from the street


Light
Of a life
Doesn't choose
So get used to abuse
As the chance of a life full of loving and comfort
Is equal to waking up under a monster




Don’t listen to the crows 
They’re nothing but beady little eyes
Beastly creatures of the night
Beware of the corvid black 


Don’t be fooled when their feathers glisten
-- He’s bad don’t listen
They fly in the air and block out the moon
-- We keep him locked up in his room


--Don’t trust what he says
--He doesn’t care if you’re dead
--he cares even less
--than the bug in the shed
--that crawls into light
--flips over and dies


Don’t speak to him
--don’t speak to him


[[
Stop! You don’t belong in my head
speaking  and prodding til I wish I were dead
You breathe in my ear until I just cry
Over and over again


Stop! I can’t bear it anymore,
I can’t cover my ears and curl up on the floor
I see nothing here, but I can’t trust my eyes
Over and over again
Over and over again…






ive been told
i lost a weight and now I
look like a ghost
haunting this place I should
call my home
im losing control 


but the voices call my name when 
sounds of children reach my brain
they lost all sense of fear
and now i must appear
but i wish theyd just leave


me alone
but its too much fuss to 
stand up on my own
it seems they wont stop cuz


they just want 
for me to haunt 
their dreams and what not
i need to pass on so leave


me alone
please just leave 
me alone
i no longer have a place
to call my own
to call my own


ive changed my mind
i think its worth try 
im gonna release 
all of my rage
and haunt the shit 
out of every stupid kid
that comes to my house
and thinks this is a game


and when the voices call my name
the sounds of children reach my brain
they now cower in fear
they come and disappear
and now they just leave


me alone
finally at peace inside 
my own home
i shoulda done this sooner


cuz theyre now caught
in this house that I haunt
and this feeling I got
just cant be bought 


cuz they leave me alone


It’s that time of the year again
The time for the spookiness to descend
We’ve let out the ghosts, who’ve come to possess,
We’ve let out the skeletons (who really never left)


We’ve let out the ghouls and the vampires too,
We’ve let out the zombies and the witches and brooms
When the mummies arrive and when Frankenstein’s here,
We can start to spread that holiday FEAR!


It’s the time to be scared, for screaming at night
It’s the time for candy and holiday fright
Oh, you’ve never seen quite a sight
And don’t you forget that it’s SPOOKY TIME!


Can you feel the tingle on your spine?
Can you feel the urge to run and hide?
Think of all the fun to be had
Before you go stark raving mad!


The party lasts from dusk till dawn
With our guests from here and from the beyond
And when the werewolves come into town
You know that things are really about to go down!


It’s the time to be scared, for screaming at night
It’s the time for candy and holiday fright
Oh, you’ve never seen quite a sight
And don’t you forget that it’s SPOOKY TIME!


It’s the time to be scared, for screaming at night
It’s the time for candy and holiday fright
Oh, you’ve never seen quite a sight
And don’t you forget that it’s SPOOKY TIME!




Intimate
Suddenly something comes slithering
Out of your ear and the moment hits
Slams on the drum with a ringing
You lost the chase and it's done


Withering
I feel the love of a struggling
Baby who's nothing but whimpering
I take pleasure in the simple things
It's the best way to keep young


Quickly
You need a place to be alone with me
Where nothing could ever get in between
Fade into half and fly into me
Now the two of us become one


Willow trees
Hanging the moon with no sympathy
That's when my vision began to bleed
I don't get rest when the city sleeps
Why don't we go have some fun?


I have no patience left
I'll take from others then
I don't intend to
Ever try to to comprehend




I can never put down these walls
I can never do what I want
Because doors keep getting shut and locked in my face


oh youre breathing and leaving again
and here i thought that maybe we were friends
well i dont wanna hang with the fake
that just says shit and then flakes
seems like youre gonna descend


DOWN TO HELL is where all fake friends go
whats in hell? like how in the hell would I know
but if you are truly down there 
then i dont fucking care 
ill go to hell and back and be blackened like charcoal


I could use a drink right now
would you like to drink with me
I think i used to think about
this cold autumn breeze
I could use a drink right now
would you like to drink with me
I think i used to think about
this cold autumn breeze




Bees buzz, flowers bloom
Pumpkins grow from the Patch, as they do


I see you through the glass pane
I cannot hear you but still you call out my name


The twilight sky is your gift for me
Every night and oh how I love you
Oh how I love you


The world fallen into my hands
The weight of it all crushed me into sand


To find one that fits like a glove
But who can tell us why we should be loved?


Yet your twilight sky is a gift to me
Every night and oh how I love you
And oh how I love you
And your twilight sky is a gift to me
Every night and oh how I love you
And oh how I love you


Something too good to be true
Oh how I desperately want to believe you


The world turns black and gray
Christopher Robin, save me from this decay


This twilight sky is a gift to me
Every night and oh how I love you
And oh how I love you
This twilight sky is a gift to me
Every night and oh how I love you
And oh how I love you


First thing I wanted to eat was
Burger and fries
A milkshake on the side so
I’d be satisfied


It’s a bit of a bother
Just waiting in line
I order the same thing
Like every time


Don’t believe in fate or destiny
But I don’t mind the wait when you’re next to me


Next thing I wanted to do was
Grow old and die
They told me that’s not the point but I was
Pretty sure they lied


Just ignore all the problems
Ignore all the pain
So goddamn lucky 
To be entertained 


Don’t believe in fate or destiny
But I don’t mind the wait when you’re next to me


Last thing I wanted to be was
Laying by your side 
On waves of silence soft and sweet
Floating through your mind


From the rivers of Autumn
To rain in the Spring
One day you’ll be gone 
I won’t know what to think


What’s the point of fate or destiny
When I can’t even have you next to me


If I didn’t want for anything
Till the day I die
Would it all be better would we
Never have to cry
It’s a bit of a bother
It’s a bit of a pain
Are we just treading water 
Are we going insane


While I worried about where we were heading
The time passed me by and I wasn’t ready




I peek into every window
And they all invite me in
Playing twister with a twisted version
Put together with tape and strings
And I’m certified onlooker and I ain’t no looker
How could I participate?
When I open wide the merchandise
Well I just can’t relate


I don’t need your fists around my wrists
There’s nothing in your eyes
When you envelop me with jealousy
Do you try to terrify?
When I resist, do you know the difference
In my word or in my mind?
Cuz my family can’t even see
And they’ve done more than try
Don’t you see?


I’ve been all alone down Avery road
I see loving passersby
Playing with each other like a mother
Violates her child
But never mind, I stutter, I ain't like no other
Or at least that's what I'm cursed
To believe in as my demons read me
Sermons in our church


And I'm shaky like I'm breaking up
In pieces made of clay
And I'm held together, welded, tether
With rope and string and tape
And I could never live my dreams
In the way I wanted most
George is lashing out at ashes
Looking like he's seen a ghost
Don't you know?


I breathe into every window
Writing, please take me away
But I'm too sober to solder together
My hands tight to my face
And demons cry laughing and I'm trapped in
To sit alone and flay
Of all the people I could be well
This one's just a waste


Playing twister with a twisted version
And all the sinful things
I'd sit beside my phone and the intercom
Just hoping one would ring
Well I've tried stacking dynamite align just right
But it blows up in my face
I am disgusting I am everything
Beautiful human race




Fall
Into the cushion of roses
Tumble through the thorns
Thrown into the edge  of the
Nothing but blades hidden by lore 
Of red.


So much red.
So much 
Red.




There are things. we’ll never know
Where are things that we’d know
Don’t know where to go
Don’t know where to go
Don’t know where to go
Where to go


Lost




Here I was the afternoon
On a bench me and you
I started to talk
You raised your hand 
I looked a away 
I was a lesser man


Here I am
Bus stop
I looked down 
The sidewalk
There you are
Standing there
I tried to speak 
But all I felt was despair


I’m just a boy 
I got my head in the clouds
I’m stuck in the sky 
I don’t know my way out 
I wish I knew 
Just what to do
All I know is this
I’m stuck here with you


As time flew by 
so did I
I kept on coming
And you did too 
But I’d given up
On dating you


But the warm days came
And the school ends soon
And here I was still standing with you
But then you looked at me
Smiled and said
I know we don’t talk but I’m glad we met


 I’m just a boy 
I got my head in the clouds
I’m stuck in the sky 
I don’t know my way out 
I wish I knew 
Just what to do
All I know is this
I’m stuck here with you


Do humans dream of sheep
I dont think that they do
If i could fall asleep
would you let me dream of you
dream of you


Ive been so foolish
to let you into me
cuz now that your leaving
I cant stop the bleeding


we speak through trances and dreams
about the code in our programs
i need you to dance with me 
i need to hear if you can
before i dream of you again
before i dream of you again


i never take action 
but im not relaxing
im going so fast 
i can feel myself  crashing


we speak through trances and dreams
about the code in our programs
i need you to dance with me 
i need to hear if you can
before i dream of you again
before i dream of you again
before i dream of you again
before i dream of you again




Eh, I prefer the cat. 
He hates Mondays.
We can all relate.
I'm done waiting for a sign
though I'd have liked to hear your voice
if you had the time


I've often told this story of mine
though I'd have liked to hear your side
if you'd had
if you'd had the time


Take your time and I'll take it too
What on earth belongs to you?
What could this path be made for but my feet?


The world we walk well it's all mine
That's why the world sees through my eyes
It becomes clearer when you choose to see


The signs have been revolving
Around a black hole we're falling


Here I'll sneer when the mourners weep
Every moment beyond belongs to me


What do you do when you got nothing to do
Do you do nothing or you do your dues
We sometimes want something to do
And sometimes we don’t want to do things we gotta do
so we do nothing when we’re doing something 
but we want something when we’re doing nothing
Well anyways uh here’s me doing what I do


I walk along the streets
I walk below the trees
I walk because I’m free
I walk because I’m me


I sit and I stand
And I talk cause I can
I listen when I want
And I’m feeling all these thoughts


Alright Let’s switch it up here


Am I happy, I don’t know
Am I sad, I think no 
Am I happy, is it true
Am I joyous or am I fool


Is it a choice or not
Can happiness be bought
Too many questions to little answers
I’m just running around getting glances
I hate thinking I should stop 
I’m just too lost in  thought


Be here be there be everywhere
Just remember to take good care
Just be safe that’s what matters
Hang on to your life it might shatter
Be careful you never know
When things just might go 


Am I happy, I don’t know
Am I sad, I think no 
Am I happy, is it true
Am I joyous or am I fool


Is it a choice or not
Can happiness be bought
Too many questions to little answers
I’m just running around getting glances
I hate thinking I should stop 
I’m just too lost in thought


Sweet lips of mine on the mountain tops
Ate apple pie to get over the troughs
Yeah I’ve seen enough, I’ve been through a lot
Dream her lips on mine on the mountain tops


And out on the porch with our warm drinks
We didn’t really do much of anything
With our hands on our eyes let the heat sink
Back into our spines as we sip our warm drinks


And you don’t have to be somewhere in between
Travel back and forth, let me go to sleep
I will be here tomorrow, I will be here on the hour
Let the worlds collide and watch the fields flower


Sink your teeth in, there’s a lot to chew
All the people here with their brown colored shoes
They don’t matter to me but they do to you
We haven’t forgotten


And in the middle of the night, I will be inside
In the blood colored sheets and right between your eyes
I will be here tomorrow, I will be here tonight
Let the worlds collide and watch the birds taking flight


My brain always works higher than the law
Creating the world from sea to mountaintop
But it was me that tasted sweet
When you put your lips on me
I felt the burn of a thousand seconds
I felt the turn of our worst intentions
It’s
Nice to
Meet you
When the gas around explodes
Senseless
Wish I was scentless
The devil’s sulfur will reach your nose


Wish that I
Didn’t have eyes
Nice to
Meet you
So that I could hear you sigh
Nice to
Meet you


Oh how easy it is to forget
How easily the visions flow
Bad descisions will lead to the rest
You can see me running to
Cross the road


Why did you stare
Why did you even care
That I didn't get hit by a car
(nyoom)


I saw you there
And as you wave and cheer
I wonder why I ran so far


It's nothing special
But when I'm feeling sentimental
Tend to remember when we'd run towards that fall
But now I'm thinking
if this is what it is then
I guess I wasn't really missing much at all


I never wanted to code anyway
and no one's gonna stop me from running away
and maybe I'd be better off that way
but no one's gonna stop me


even if it means I have to leave
even if it means I have to leave my…


Before I think
I'll be doing laps around you
And everything
Circumvents the unreasonable hue


I think I'll be late
To the end of time
If it's all the same
I'd like a second try or a new game+ or another life


Before I die
I'll be nothing but ordinary
I won't catch the eye
Of a lover or adversary


I think I'm early
To before my time
But I can't leave
I owe too much to everyone I lent the bulk of my stolen advice


Be with me, voice behind the screen
Leave only when needed
And I promise I will let you live
In ways you're only dreaming
And when it comes to us
There is nobody else I trust


Be with me, Oh Comely
Breathe in like you mean it
The tallest vowels you can shape
The highest notes you're screaming
And when the big bad man busts down your door
We'll come up to bat, bash his brains out on the floor


Be with me, oh family
Greet me with a meaning
Cuz everybody's got a troubled
Past and I don't need it
Your voice is always in line
Your voice is always in mine


Be with me, oh Slot Machine
Me and you ain't meeting
I hope you're driving down an endless
Interstate and speeding
Another movie of beauty went by too fast
It's my mistake to to mute it and that won't be the last
No!


Come to me, oh melody
Save me from this fighting
I seem to always find a way
Of moving on like lightning
Maybe the other side
Maybe the other side


Be with me, infinity
If I'm not all I wanna be
Bless me on the other side
Bless me on the other side


Humor me, infinity
If birds and bees ain't fermenting
Bless me on the other side
Bless me on the other side


Come to me, infinity
When my ship sinks to syncope
Bless me on the other side
Bless me on the other side


That's if I make it
That's if I make it
That's if I make it
Yeah, that's if I make it


It's Christmas time baby go and get all your stockings
It's been a long year I hope the next one's rocking
The presents roll in for the Christmas tree
That one's got a bow I wonder what it could be
The joy's so infectious I feel it all the time
I hear the jingle bells, everything's so sublime
Santa's coming soon with his sack of presents
I can't wait for this year's Christmas


It's Christmas time, baby, comes around every year
I'm driving around town trying to spread some cheer
They ask me what I want for Christmas, I don't know
I tell them what I want but I don't want coal


I want some hot chocolate and a roaring fire
I also wanna nap because I'm so tired
There's too many things in too little years
I hate asking for gifts, it just isn't sincere


It's Christmas time, baby, go and get all your stockings
It's been a long year, I hope the next one's rocking
The presents roll in for the Christmas tree
That one's got a bow, I wonder what it could be
The joy's so infectious, I feel it all the time
I hear the jingle bells, everything's so sublime
Santa's coming soon with his sack of presents
I can't wait for this year's Christmas


It's Christmas time baby, go and get all your stockings
It's been a long year, I hope the next one's rocking
The presents roll in for the Christmas tree

The joy's so infectious, I feel it all the time
I hear the jingle bells, everything's so sublime
Santa's coming soon with his sack of presents
I can't wait for this year's Christmas

You look so pretty watching over me
In the city invented by my dreams
What's up with you? I'm eating all the fruit
Forbidding me from seeing you
From seeing you


The moon's so bright it blinds us
Absorbs the light and finds a
Way to fill the hole but when it's gone
It bores another in your
Soul
Can I see you I don't
Know
Living life and letting
Go


Don't break it down to pieces
Don't question it, just leave it
It doesn't make sense
Not in the least
But there's nothing better
For me
Pulling my leg
Pulling my teeth
Just to pull one over me
Don't break it down


So nice so fitting, another set of skin
What I call living's not what I'm living in
What's up? What's down?
I'm falling fast asleep
And there's no way out


I'm going fast and feeling
Slow
Speed limit testing on these
roads
Living life and letting
Go


Don't break it down to pieces
Don't question it, just leave it
Just stare into your ceiling
Pretend there is no meaning
Don't break it down to pieces
Don't break it down to pieces
Don't break it down


As lights flash and sounds crash
Honey what more could you ask
For all the smiles
Haven't seen you in a while
But don't take this the wrong way
I prefer the quiet days
And most that I know can't
Fit into my own plan


My temper took a dive last night
When I remembered your red eyes
They looked to be just like how I
Imagined demons would look like
But now I see a brighter shade
It blisters from below my face
The sins and synonyms thereof
With every metaphor I shove


But I've been dragging my feet
Out on the edge of the street
But it's a little too much
A little too much
Yeah it's a little too much for me
Yeah it's a little too much for me


And lights pass but don't stop
These days all I do is walk
Throwing my line
In contaminated tides
I swear I've got the wrong face
My insides are all misplaced
And constantly pull me
To everywhere they could be


A friend believed in me one time
And with the wind around my sides
Within a Christmas light lit night
In smokey breath filled sighs, I lied
But I won't lie, it did feel nice
Covered in red that wasn't mine


But I've been dragging my feet
Out on the edge of the street
But it's a little too much
A little too much
Yeah it's a little too much for me
And I'll be saying it every week
Yeah it's a little too much for me
Yeah it's a little too much for me


Tuning fades from half my wilting brain
Soon it bades void aft I’m sick insane
Fog blows up a cover; a smoke screen
God knows what I’m after; a hope and dream


Stories from the past!
 (There’s still much they haven’t heard)
Glory, love, acast!
 (Where none touch, not even birds)


You know better I can’t even end my things now anyway
Through my effort, time keeps stealing everything away


And I… wanna see the same caves
And I’d…  love to get lost in those mazes




I have not forgotten- my role!
It was not for nothing- so!
Soon will come an era, where things comes anew!


Bad thoughts are incendiary
Be careful what you carry
We can’t keep holding on to the past
The futures there just waiting
The past will just keep fading
There’s really only one way to go


We gotta keep going forward
We gotta keep pushing onward
We know what to do
Do it right


We gotta keep it moving 
We gotta keep improving 
Follow your heart it’s not wrong


We’re taking the right steps
We’re ready for what’s next 
I can’t wait to see where we go


Chorus


We go beyond 
We go above 
We soar through the stars 
We never give up


We’ve been to the moon 
We’ve been to the sun
We’ve traveled so far
And we’re not done 


I’ve been to places 
You could never imagine
I followed my heart
It’s no all magic


We’ve gone above 
We’ve gone beyond
It’s not just luck
We kept moving on


We’ve gone above 
We’ve gone beyond 
We do everything to keep going up


X3
We’ve gone above 
We’ve gone beyond 
What hAppens when we reach the top 


We go beyond 
We go above 
We soar through the stars 
We never give up


We’ve been to the moon 
We’ve been to the sun
We’ve traveled so far
And we’re not done 


I’ve been to places 
You could never imagine
I followed my heart
It’s no all magic


We’ve gone above 
We’ve gone beyond
It’s not just luck
We kept moving on


we all shop at michaels
to black out our curtains
and cut ourselves with scalpels
to feel some hurting
it takes too long to go anywhere
i guess ill just starve to death
it takes too long to think any thoughts
i guess ill just guess


i would hunt you down
for a thousand days
if you were around
conjuring your chains
memories you keep
that were never played out
Beyond my wildest dreams
somethings coming out my mouth
spiders in my teeth 
do you like me now
spiders in my teeth 
do you like me now


i will drive you insane
when we're inches from the grave
we could go into oncoming traffic
but im too attached to your lane


this world has yet to change
in the last 3 years
im so good at charades
acting like ive lived
before ive deceased
laying on the floor
cuz my back is killing me
the threads are in the clouds
like the memories you keep
that were never played out
Beyond my wildest dreams
somethings coming out my mouth
spiders in my teeth 
do you like me now
spiders in my teeth 
do you like me now
spiders in my teeth 
do you like me now
spiders in my teeth 
do you like me now


Six stars shining bright
Six stars guide us through the night
In a circle like a crown
Shine from heaven to the ground


Seventh star, where are you from?
A new descendant of the sun?
Fallen from the comet’s tail
Shine brightly through the veil


Bring your new light to the sky
Those who run will see you fly
Take your throne up with the moon
The heavens hold a place for you


Can you forgive
The decisions of your sorry cousin?
If you will live
The fantasy that does and doesn’t
If it’s no gyp
Then turn the tuner, ride the rosin
Let’s all submit
And prove neither of us are rotten

If you let me in then come on in
My skin feels like it’s drizzling
Won’t you please receive me?
For I’m looking for a home to call my own
Own it up and wear it proud
Only then we evade the sound
Tell me that you feel so
Hopeless to describe it all
I know
Oh I know


I know it’s a tough pill to swallow
You’ve got a tough act to follow
Rise again oh why's it always
Gotta be predictably baffling?
I can be around sometimes
Not always the patient type
Tell me how you feel faux
Finding the right words
Oh I know
Oh I know


I believed we're losing touch
Can't say how much I'm proven wrong
I'll probably still love up until
The hour my body's had its fill
I know it might seem hard to sing
I only got a head start on things
Tell me you are beyond hope
And I could never know
But I know
Oh I know


It’s New Year’s Eve 
I’ve left you alone
Come another span
There’s room in this old attic
Dust it off
Lay your blanket
This space is all yours
To spew your flitting thoughts
And I’ll pinch your face
Until it leaks and oozes all over the floor
(haha just kidding)
What more is there for you
So
Come Home
Come Home
Come home
Speak to me with your thoughtless words
Don’t wordlessly think nothing of
Anything
I still don’t know you well 
I’ve looked and toiled over your
Edges lines and nonexistent curves
I still don’t know you well 


I promise
I won’t rip your face off
I promise
I won’t gut you in your kidney
I promise
You will be tough to let go




Streetlights to the parking lots 
Wandering with my head of thoughts
This city built up from ground
I take the sidewalks round and round


I see the people walking about 
Their Walking down the same old route
 
Are they all happy 
Their faces might say otherwise
Are they happy
Maybe it all takes some time


We walk together 
Among the concrete trees
They’ll stand forever
and be all that we can see


We built the city 
And we’ll build higher past the moon
We fill the buildings 
Is this the future or our doom


Glide from streets and avenues 
And Work mornings to afternoons
The Monotony  from day to day
Crippling the mind for little pay


Opportunity presents itself
So we stack people on building shelves
There’s millions upon millions 
Will we climb into the billions
How are we together 
When I feel so alone 


We walk together 
Among the concrete trees
They’ll stand forever
and be all that we can see


We built the city 
And we’ll build higher past the moon
We fill the buildings 
Is this the future or our doom


play your cards the way you always wanted to
you talk a lot of game boy
you always talk the same boy


Funny now that you mention it
I cant forget your name boy
you never seem to change boy


Over by the warehouse doors
we can let it out
something we never used before
its more fun when we arent allowed
I could do the same things
and same would go for you
we are just pretending
entertained till face turns blue




The world’s ending again
The world’s ending again
Hope that this’d be different, hoped I wouldn’t see it through
But the world’s ending for me and you


So burn the fields I spent the time to sow
Leave this place that I lovingly called home
Burn the tree you told me’d reach to the sky
How I’d wish you’d finish it before you said goodbye


Maybe I spent too much time learning how to fly
Never noticing the way the days kept passing by
All these riches I’ve amassed will never compensate
The regret I feel everyday I don’t see your face


All alone
Deep beneath the earth I’m
All alone
Hoping it won’t hurt


The world’s ending again
The world’s ending again
I told you that I loved you, I told myself not to cry
The world’s ending but I’m not ready to die


So I’ll burn this patch that I grew for you
Blow it all to hell, isn’t that what you’d want me to do?
You never needed anything I brought to your side
“The man who had it all,” guess I wasn’t worth your time


Maybe I spent too much time learning how to fly
Never noticing the way the days kept passing by
All these riches I’ve amassed will never compensate
The regret I feel everyday I don’t see your face


All alone
Deep beneath the earth I’m
All alone
The only one who hurts


All alone
And I will bring the end
All alone
Till I see you again




I wasn’t much of a big time spender
You won’t see me dying in the city on a bender
But I must have delayed a bad financial state
That I could never stave off even in the gold days
Coughing away inside the cellar
My mom, I wouldn’t tell her but it’s looking like Old Yeller
But my boss called in and I calmly
Answered the phone, listened to him go


Will you take the night shift?
When the doors lock inside and out
Well I’d be delighted
I could use the extra hours
Well make sure to sign in
Time sheet’s due by
8 or 9
I’m taking on the night shift


I downed a cup of Sunshine cherry
Sick of the drink and weary of the moral query
Strutted away for anybody’s gaze
I think I could be sinking into tarmac and the pavement
From men to women, it doesn’t matter
Close the gap and half of us will scatter sadder
I saw scatman play a song and
Opened up to smoke and dust


Will you take the night shift?
Hope you wake up on the regular side of the bed
Think you’ll be alright, kid?
We could get someone else instead
Don’t think I can hide it
My eyelids feel
Tied to my thighs
I’m taking on the night shift


Bathe in fluorescent lighting
My cell of yellow and white
Ain’t it terrifying?
I hear a shifting within the pipes
Change gears into night shift
Driving from a
Red light
I’m late for the night shift


Get a load of the night shift
We have decided
Society’s really gone downhill
It’s undivided
Between me and the nobodies around here
Speaking of the night shift
I did something
Bad last night
While working on the night shift




How do you do music?
Is any of this right?
I don't really know if
This is something that you'd like
But I had to try


How do you sing?
Am I even close?
Someone please tell me
I really don't know
Y'know?


Everybody sucks
In the beginning
But it's just practice
And not about winning
It's not about winning


You cope with your fear
Of being disliked
By attacking
Every note that you've typed
And that isn't right


Check it
You think that self criticality
Can be used as a shield from reality
In doing so, you stunt your growth
And who really knows who that hurts the most?




Desperate times calls for desperate measures
Worthless tries that that aren't so clever


in spirits we trust we say
what happened to the people alive today




owo
we will do anything
owo
except perish


the clocks keep ticking, all hidden from sight
out of mind, but that ain't right
how can a hive protect its queen
when the everyone is ignoring the beast


owo
we ask for help from the mister
owo
he stares with nothing but contempt
nothing but contempt




This is the ballad of my mechanical degree
It was simple when it was geometry
As the years continued my life past me by
My homework piled up it piled past the sky
I don’t know how much I can take of all this
I don’t want more math and I don’t want no physics


Hey you you’re good at math I know what you should try 
Several years later I think I am going to cry
Maybe this semester will be better than last
Heat transfer, Dms, oh this will be a blast
But I keep on trucking through there isn’t that much left
Once this is all done maybe I can just rest


I don’t know if I can this anymore 
I tried so hard but whats it for
Is it worth all this college work
One more year of this could make me go berserk


I don’t know if I can this anymore 
I try so hard but whats it for
Is this worth all of my time
I don’t know if I can make it out alive

Prince of Darkness call me King of Evil
Here since day one, I’m a bit primeval
Triforce of power boutta whoop yo ass
Don’t need courage or wisdom to send a Link to the Past


The last thing that you see imma be your Demise
Thought that you could win this? Well you’re in for a surprise
Diss you so bad it’s gonna be a Calamity
Challenging me is the proof of your insanity


Hero of Time? Don’t get me started on him
He’s jealous cause I got his girl sealed in a gem
Couldn’t get to my level even if he had a hookshot
Gonna need a Goron Tunic cuz this roast is too hot


So grab your ocarina and play a lullaby
The only thing that’s putting me to sleep is your rhymes
Gonna take this W like how I took over Hyrule
7 years later just to end up lookin like a fool


Wearing all these masks got you lookin like a clown
Stupid ass tunic lookin like you in a gown
Wanna save the world? You couldn’t save castle town
So climb up this tower, I’ll send you right back down


I banished Phantom Ganon cause I don’t need no cronies
Once this battle’s over, I’ll expose you as a phony
Always riding round on that stupid little pony
I’d pull out my sword, but for this battle there’d be no need


King of the Gerudos, ruling over all the realm
Can end you in an instant with any one of my spells
Gonna need another fairy since I’ve taken all your health
Time to face the facts, Link: cause you’ve been overwhelmed


I'm cleared from asylum for something I didn't need
Looking for love, they said, well the light is green
There it is, blow a kiss, show some sign you're interested
Anything on the list is better than what you're doing


I keep on hearing things
Of all this endless suffering
And all of my empathic reactions tend to come out slow


They lock their secrets up in a major key
What part of living this life here was made for me?
I saw their missiles go up, out on New Year's Eve
What part of living this life here was made for me?


Rock me to sleep
Hope that I dream
Hope that I don't
Turn out quite as timid as I seem


I want you to know
I'm trying to grow
I'm trying to be a person
Who's not constantly this low


But it's getting hard
And we're getting old
I wonder if I'll ever
Get to tell you I was bold


It hurts in my heart
It hurts in my soul
It hurts to know
That all of this is out of my control


I want it to end
Or I want things to change
I wish that all the circumstances
Could just be exchanged


So that you could see
What happened to me
And maybe if you saw
Those things then you would agree


So cast me a line
Or throw me a bone
Maybe then the two of us
Wouldn't feel so alone


Just rock me to sleep
Maybe then you'd see
I became the person
I always was meant to be


To be a cool dude 
Its true 
you just gotta be me
yeah im supa cool you see
on topic
aw epic 


He said he was waiting for a rap, 
but i didn't tell him it was gonna be crap
now we stop to have an intermission
to take a pause from the stuff im dishin


oh yeah im the best singer in the world except i can't rhyme
im so funny  i say funny stuff all the burger


talk about a comeback
I won't come back


haha just kidding it's an subvert of an expectation
another one for the nerds of text and patience
no lie
this is the killer stuff
if it was a man it'd be super buff


Its tough to be cool like me
to be tall like me
to be epic like me
I'm epic
so epic
yeah
yuh
Y


Turning tumbling whirlwinds 
Send me fly me to the end
Turning tumbling whirlwinds 
Send me fly me to the end
How much longer do we go 
How longs long again
How much longer do we go 
How longs long again
 
Twisting Tumbling whirlwind
You brought me my untimely end
Spinning through my twisted mind
Todays the day I finally die
Turning Blazing whirlwind
I want to live can I extend
Please accept my dying plea
I’ve done no wrong please set me free


Winds grow faster every day 
Blowing gusting any way
Flowing Blasting through the air
Streams are restless everywhere
Anger building up above
How longs long again
Winds have come to pay respects
How longs long again


Twisting Tumbling whirlwind
You brought me my untimely end
Spinning through my twisted mind
Todays the day I finally die
Turning Blazing whirlwind
I want to live can I extend
Please accept my dying plea
I’ve done no wrong please set me free


think of a distance
from there to here
from you to me
and add 2 light years
this sweet resistence 
in the breaths I take
will comeback to bite me
one of these days


and i think you were far away
if you were even there in the first place




i had a dream
one time I think
every star and every planet
seemed to sink


into one place
into one place
into one place
into one place
into one place
into one place
into one place
cant feel the empty space


and i would have said you
were far away
and you were set adrift in the
far reaches of space
sometimes i like to


think of a distance
from there to here
from you to me
and add 2 light years
think of a distance
from there to here
from you to me
and add 2 light years




I wake up groggy and overblown
And try to recreate the opening from other songs
But it seems last night's dreams weigh heavy
I think I measure a bit shorter than I did last week
Oh no


Where'd my friends all go?
To a land of opportunity and mental woes
But I know when I forget my words
I hear a thunderstorm reminding me to take it slow


I believed we're damned for eternal nothing when we sleep
And I believed we found the second coming later that week
I turn and toss til time takes pity
I know everyone's asked but really
What's wrong with me?


I could bleed without needing something fine
Frankline, drain the sand out of my mind


I wanted to fly away
I guess I won't try today
Another reminder to delay
I took a suppressant and
I almost got a second chance
I'll never forget that Saturday


I believed the sand was just my body all these years
Where were you when grains had started running down my ears?
Fog on my windshield, stains included
I'm always out of wiper fluid
What's wrong with me?


I could cheat and still feel nothing inside
I'm so weak but I still try picking fights
I can't weep when a family member dies
I could scream but it still comes off as quiet


I wanted to fly away
I guess I won't try today
Another reminder to delay
I love in a different way
I'm told it will be okay
Another reminder to delay


Y'all said that you liked it when I did the rap
I guess that I had to come and bring it back
I had to show all you that this shit ain't whack
and when I'm on the mic I'm like that big ol rat


talking biggie cheese and I know that you know that
rapping with ease and you owe me a whole bag
burning degrees and I wont stop the flow
be rapping till y'all say that you want to hear some more


listen there's just a couple things 
I think you guys aren't seeing about me
so lemme break it down for you
and make sure you listen carefully


I never will cease and I am not deceased
I'm not wearing fleece my name it ain't Reece
my rap skills increase I ain't got a niece
I'm afraid of geese and getting obese


I'm not eating grease but I'm burning it up
I'm putting all the juice inside of my cup
talking bout rap game I'm boutta disrupt
and if you come for me then your end be abrupt


I'm rapping on this shit like it's tic-tac-toe
don't ask if I'll win because I already know
I hope for your sake that you are not my foe
and if you really are then I'll toss you to and fro


My words they be sticking inside of your brain
because when you hear it you know it ain't lame
you know that when I spit it's a different game
and you know that I'm setting this whole field aflame


I'm starting a war like this place is ukraine
and I'm on a mission hope it's not in vain
to make sure my lines are far from mundane
and show you my rap competency insane




Playing yahtzee just like always
Pick your dice up throw them my way
You don’t know they way they’ll roll
But one mistake and I’ll grab your soul


Kings and queens on either side
Fighting pieces black and white
It’s e4 e5 games begun
Trades and tactics, checkmate it’s done


It’s more than just a game
It’s more than my fantasy
It’s my a way life 
It’s my swiss army knife


It’s more than just a game
It’s more for me
It’s so mystical
So unnatural
Nothing else that I have ever seen


Sometimes somethings
Aren’t some so simple
Changing pictures 
Trying to grip you
Signs are saying
Hands are waving 
Guess it was not my time


It’s more than just a game
It’s more than my fantasy
It’s my a way life 
It’s my swiss army knife


It’s more than just a game
It’s more for me
It’s so mystical
So unnatural
Nothing else that I have ever seen




fall in fall out
fall in fall out
fall in fall out
fall in fall out


i take off all the holidays
and only left us with
decrepit bottles of champaign 
with bottoms turned


up side down
you started to fall 
in and fall out
the crown you wear is about to 
make you drown
if only you
if only you could
hear me out
the world would be better if 
you were here now


i get off all the holidays 
that dont even matter 
if you were parting ways again
would you let us
take you home
owo
the roads have frozen and yet 
our lives have turned


up side down
you started to fall in and fall out
the crown you wear is about to 
make you drown
if only you
if only you could


hear me out
a quiet tongue
is speakign louder 
than i can shout
i could write essays but I wouldnt know
what theyre about
suddenly your world opens up
through the clouds 
so let me make you
fall in fall out
fall in fall out
fall in fall out
fall in fall out
Rooftops running faster all the time
Could you be looking for
Something that you might’ve left behind
Cuz that acorn that you buried in the fall
(If that’s something you recall)
Has grown into a mighty tree


They say that life is “for the birds,” 
but so’s that feeder so get off of there
Your feet like children footsteps running up the staircase
That’s made from my rooftop with the snow melting bringing in the spring
Ain’t it the prettiest thing?


I wanna be squirrels in love
I wanna be squirrels in love
Chasing for hours
Running through the showers up above


But don’t play in the street
Or you’ll make your mother weep
As she sees your mangled corpse
Cooking on the concrete
With your tongue all hanging out
And you feet pointed towards the sky
Enough to make a grown man cry


I’d rather see squirrels in love
I wanna be squirrels in love
Chasing for hours
Empowered by what we can become


Squirrels in love




If this thing ever breaks its rules for me
I'd have you speak for yourself
existing like a couple  fools are we
But I'd fool the the fates just to help...


All the suspense and the dances
of hurrying... while we're still worrying what we have left...
Take all the answers, just and fold em and bury em.
it's so much to carry but I'll hold you nonetheless 


delicate mannequins, all flushed and bold
a heartier soul blinking fast
fingers are handling the tales of old
they slip-- and they fumble 
but until they slumber there's 


All the suspense and the dances of hurrying..
while we're still worrying what we have left... 
Dig up the answers, then burn em like carrion 
carried as dust blown away on your breath... 


All the suspense and the dances of hurrying 
while we're still worrying what we have next... 
forgo false phrases you're forced into parroting 
for all you have seen is all you have left...






Step 1
Pick it up
Play it cool
Play a tune
Think about all the things that made you say
"I don't know, I'm feeling some sorta way"


Get it down
Simple sounds
Plan it out
We'd move on farther than step 1
But it just says "Refer to the above"


Feel baby teeth growing back
And the training wheels slow the impact
Feels like I've gone back to class
I gotta go to step 1


Step 1
Just begun
Never done
Show rerun
Make sure not to let it sit for long
But just enough that it's not underdone


Take what's mine


Better times
Simple rhymes
Think about all the things that made you laugh
Or made you wanna snap someone in half


All my friends are coming back
And they'll leave a couple weeks after that
But that love will pave a path
I gotta go back
I gotta go back
I gotta go to step 1


A body wrapped in stone
Told me I am not alone
So I give this final pact


I swear I'll get my life on track
And I'll die a couple years after that
From a deadly heart attack
Then I can go back
Then I can go back
Then I can go to step 1




Booyah I'm telling the truth
smooth sailing's here when I'm rapping to you
Like a jar of nutter butter, of course non crunchy
also other brands that are smooth and non crunchy
There's a bit of inevitabilities that go in this schick
like references of TV like Thanos and Rick-
And Morty, a thing I've no feelings for
Lord just knows I'm just ranting about things in store
Where I currently reside, 
next to chips in aisle
and im taking while
tryna stand in style
just making a rhyme
plus i take my time
blocking a guy
who's got a bag of fries
right
I'm hungry and I'm on a crunch
No lunch and starving (watashi hungy)
..
now there's a kid with this mommy
yeah. take it down


Hamburger Cheeseburger big Mac whopper
Hamburger Cheeseburger big Mac whopper
Hamburger Cheeseburger big Mac whopper
Hamburger Cheeseburger big Mac whopper


I got a cheeseburger with a coke on the side
Can I add some chicken nuggies and a medium fries


I got some pasta and some breadsticks too
What can we add to this mix of food


Got my tacos and some chips on the side
Can I get myself ready for a tex mex ride


Can never get too much fast food
It might be unhealthy, but it tastes so good


Just guy with a appetite
I’m eating everything tonight
Just guy with a appetite
I’m Eating everything in sight 


I’m Consuming with gluttony 
I’m Soon to strike obesity
All these Calories and fatty foods
Oh this all cannot be too good


Fish fillet’s at Chick Fil as
I’m batteries like double A’s
Burritos at a chipotle 
Sippn out a lemonade
I’m eating with the burger king
While wendy got me whispering
The drive thru light still flickering
Does the taco bell still hit the ring


McDonalds serving all the goods
The dairy queen has been secured
The whataburger understood
That Jack and boxes have procured
The following of Sub a ways
Dishing out the mayonnaise
I’m pulling up here every day
This 9-5 don’t get me payed
Okay              okay


Just guy with a appetite
I’m eating everything tonight
Just guy with a appetite
I’m Eating everything in sight 


I’m Consuming with gluttony 
I’m Soon to strike obesity
All these Calories and fatty foods
Oh this all cannot be too good




Drive up to Dallas
Drive up to Austin
I'm not here now 
But I'll be here often enough
Often enough


I ate my fill like last November 
It wasn't enough for me 
All the  words I said I just can't remember 
But more importantly


There's mountains on your skin
 a range of emotion


Your face is obvious 
Obvious to me
What an ominous
Ominous age to be
Youre so obvious
Obviously
In your state of 
Missouri


Your face is obvious 
Obvious to me
What an ominous
Ominous age to be
Youre so obvious
Obviously
In your state of
Missouri




Could you look him in the eye
The night your brother died?
Knowing a man far away
And the life he could’ve saved


When his voice reached your ears
Did it confirm your biggest fears?
That his words brought no life
And those within would see no light 


As you toiled for your love
Your sister knew of things above 
Did you understand him then?
Or Did he break your heart again?


When you said that you believed
Did that bring you a reprieve?
Or did you twist that knife
Deeper in your soul with every lie?


I live inside houses on 2nd street
I sing in my sleep til my pillow weeps
And I'm drafted too long
But I think I'm still gone
Cuz one thing's for sure
I'm not her
And I can have beautiful dreams
But there's just as many
As the ones that don't make sense


Little houses, little girl
I know one thing, that's for sure
Plastic parts and wooden cars
Come now demon, have a heart
Little houses, literal
I was famished, now I'm full


I tried to run
But I'm not fast
I tried to hide
But I have a fat
Ass


No matter which way
I had looked
I couldn't find 
Myself a nook


No spot could hide them
not even close
the gigantic cheeks
beneath my clothes


And all could hear them
As I ran by
The thunderous clapping
of my thighs


A butt this big
Just couldn't last
two giant meatballs
for an ass


In my hindquarters
you could find
the length of borders
as they've been lined


I fear my backside
Is my demise
I call my friends
say my goodbyes


My haunches were
too much to take
too big a back end
my last mistake


So this is it
my last farewell
they'll get me soon
and throw me in a cell


I hear them coming
here for my bum
It seems I'm right
I couldn't run


but one last thing
before I go




hey nelly, we'll come to the sea together
and everything you've known will be just washed away
I know you have never seen new york
and honestly neither have I
I'm sure it'll be great

and I don't know how I got it to be honest
Nelly...

They would trade an 
eye for an eye from you
an eye for an eye from you
Always sleeping
side by side with mouths open wide
and Id trade mine too


brother im dizzy i feel fine
angel with dissonance in mind
incinerate yourself youre too bright
brother im missing all your dyes


They would trade an 
eye for an eye from you
an eye for an eye from you
Always sleeping
side by side with mouths open wide
and Id trade mine too


I would trade an 
eye
I would trade an 
eye
I would trade an 
eye
I would trade an eye
 
another whisper in my spine


brother is this part of your plan
all of my fingers lay in your hand
brother im dizzy i feel fine
devilish innocence till the end of time


They would trade an 
eye for an eye from you
an eye for an eye from you
Always sleeping
side by side with mouths open wide
and Id trade mine too


I would trade an 
eye
I would trade an 
eye
I would trade an 
eye
I would trade an eye


Eden calls for ad campaigns this fall
Come and see where Adam blew it all
Even all our pain will tire
Fade along with our desire
Tomorrow I will walk around the mall


After all the filler finally passed
Won't you weep the time that you can't have?
The melodies you won't create
Intimacy you overrate
I can hear your sobs turn into laughs


Lucky that we've found each other here
Something behind us can disappear
We may have wrecked the whole ordeal
At least I was behind the wheel
Let's take back what's ours my dear


Is this what you know me for now?
I've got to end it all somehow




I can't
Just write
a song
today


There's no time
and no talk
and no trust
no way


I want
to be done
but not yet
and not even close


I feel like if I just keep writing
then maybe this song will go


and I can be done with this
and I can start something new
and maybe I'm dumb for this
cuz it feels like this is all I do


and it feels like not even a thousand sunsets could come close
and it feels like I wont ever realize if I really know
it feels like if I could just make it last forever I would
and maybe if I fell into that pit then it would be good


I picked up this bot from a Chinese site I think
link was foreign and my lappy didn't ring
saying i installed a virus
your computer is dying
as the screen turns black then forms an iris
spewing monologues about world domination
robbing every human of their occupations
i think it's fine
we're kinda bros alright
worked on this song without a fight


care less bout the blood I spilled oh no
im in your head im in your head
feeling full from nothing good at all it goes

my skin is cold and dry like bones

dream it all and dream it all again don't
dream at all dont dream at all my friend


Ice age, in the modern day
Ice age, in the modern day
I say, ill be on my way
Ice age, in the modern day


Careful about the heart I fill
I know i need the sun I need the sun
When I’m dead don’t try to find a will
I am for everyone for everyone
Everybody likes to laugh until
It comes undone it comes un


dream it all and dream it all again don't

Ice age, in the modern day

I say, ill be on my way
Ice age, in the modern day

We’ve fallen to pieces 
We’ve fallen apart
We followed the trail
We followed til dawn
We lost all the answers
We struggled for our lives 
We’re left here forever 
We’re stuck here in time


But It’s not the end
Maybe there’s time
The clocks not run out
Maybe it’s fine


It’s not the end 
This is the time
Pick up the pieces 
Everythings fine
‘
It’s not the end
It’s undefined
Stay on your feet
Dont get behind


It’s not the end 
It’s not the time
Everythings gonna
Be just fine


We see the light
split all the dark
I can’t believe
We made it this far
Step into 
The other side
It’s been so long
But we’re alright


Is it the end
We’ll know in time
But for now
we’re just fine
